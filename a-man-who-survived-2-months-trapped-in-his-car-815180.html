Snow covers all roads and slows down the traffic. Some <a href=# title=cars data-link=tag>cars</a> may pull over to&nbsp;the side of&nbsp;the road and get out only with the help of&nbsp;a&nbsp;tractor. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;common thing. But one day, during a&nbsp;snowfall, something astonishing happened.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/332/015/de40145b4b9eb372cc9127f1a9.png><p>On&nbsp;December&nbsp;19, 2011, a&nbsp;man named Peter Skyllberg found himself in&nbsp;a&nbsp;snow trap after he&nbsp;drove off the main road in&nbsp;the north of&nbsp;Sweden. Then snowmobilers accidentally found him, pulled him out of&nbsp;there, and took him to&nbsp;the <a href=# title=hospital data-link=tag>hospital</a>. It&nbsp;may seem like something common, but here’s the kicker: it&nbsp;took 2&nbsp;months to&nbsp;find him. And outside at&nbsp;that time, the temperature dropped to −22 °F.</p><p>That man survived after spending 60&nbsp;days without <a href=# title=water data-link=tag>water</a>, <a href=# title=food data-link=tag>food</a>, and heat sources among <a href=# title=icy data-link=tag>icy</a> winds and endless snow. The people who found him said the car was buried deep in&nbsp;snow at&nbsp;3&nbsp;feet, and Peter Skyllberg was sitting shaking inside a&nbsp;sleeping bag in&nbsp;the front seat. He&nbsp;couldn’t speak.</p><p>When they brought him to&nbsp;the hospital, the doctors were amazed. They knew cases when people survived in&nbsp;cold temperatures for a&nbsp;long time, but not for two months. A&nbsp;person can live without water for several days. But Peter had no&nbsp;problems with this since he&nbsp;extracted water from the snow. Without food, a&nbsp;person can survive from several weeks to&nbsp;three months. But what about the cold? How did Peter solve this problem?</p><p>At&nbsp;such low temperatures, people can <a href=# title=freeze data-link=tag>freeze</a> within several hours. The doctors treating Peter claimed that his body seemed to&nbsp;activate survival mode and fell into a&nbsp;deep sleep. It’s like bears that hibernate during winter. But the human body can only lower the temperature by&nbsp;a&nbsp;few degrees. This is&nbsp;not enough to&nbsp;survive in −22°F frost. Perhaps the man somehow managed to&nbsp;lower the temperature even more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/683/ac1/1c67f4571ab78c724ab1358cd6.png><p>The case of&nbsp;Peter Skyllberg became famous. Doctors and scientists from all over the world put forward their hypotheses about how this man managed to&nbsp;survive. No&nbsp;one could give the exact reason. Many people claimed it&nbsp;was just a&nbsp;real miracle.</p><p>Others believed it&nbsp;was the result of&nbsp;several factors combined together. One of&nbsp;these factors is&nbsp;the sleeping bag. It&nbsp;helps keep your body heat better, so&nbsp;your temperature may not drop for a&nbsp;long time inside the bag. Another factor that probably played the key role was the igloo effect.</p><p>Indigenous peoples living at&nbsp;the North Pole make their homes out of&nbsp;ice and snow. You’ve probably seen these round houses on&nbsp;the Internet or&nbsp;in&nbsp;the movies. It’s not warm inside them, but it&nbsp;doesn’t let the cold&nbsp;in. The particular design of&nbsp;these houses helps keep the accumulated heat inside. Igloos can protect from strong winds, but it’s possible to&nbsp;survive inside them only if&nbsp;you’re wearing warm clothes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f6d/8b7/a4ff1553d89e47e02053c58ee2.png><p>Perhaps Peter’s car turned into such a&nbsp;house. Snow clung to&nbsp;it&nbsp;from all sides and blocked the heat inside. Many people wondered why he&nbsp;hadn’t tried to&nbsp;get out and find help. But seems like Peter did the right thing. It’s pretty dangerous to&nbsp;go&nbsp;out in&nbsp;such conditions. You don’t know where you are, it’s freezing cold and there’s a&nbsp;blizzard.</p><p>Let’s say you get out of&nbsp;the car and try to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;the nearest road. You fail and come back. But you can’t find your car because the snow has covered&nbsp;it. Now your situation is&nbsp;even worse. The only option is&nbsp;to&nbsp;start digging snow and make an&nbsp;igloo. If&nbsp;you have warm clothes, an&nbsp;igloo will help you to&nbsp;keep warm and gain some time.</p><p>But the right solution is&nbsp;to&nbsp;stay inside the car and wait for the rescuers, especially if&nbsp;you don’t know where you are. If&nbsp;you don’t have <a href=# title=communication data-link=tag>communication</a> or&nbsp;signal lights, then try to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;fire. <a href=# title=Smoke data-link=tag>Smoke</a> can attract the attention of&nbsp;people passing on&nbsp;the nearest road. Peter Skyllberg spent some time in&nbsp;the hospital, regained strength, and was cured.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/457/428/b6ae24588c80d4aa4dce15a5d6.png><p>It’s much safer to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;closed cold room or&nbsp;an&nbsp;igloo during the cold. However, if&nbsp;you’re stuck in&nbsp;a&nbsp;severe frost without warm clothes, you have about 30&nbsp;minutes to&nbsp;two hours. Maybe even less if&nbsp;you don’t move. But in&nbsp;1980, a&nbsp;miracle happened that shocked people and doctors all over the US.</p><p>19-year-old Jean Hilliard was driving home at&nbsp;night to&nbsp;the small town of&nbsp;Lengby. She lost control and ended up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;ditch. The girl decided to&nbsp;walk to&nbsp;her friend. She then saw her friend’s house, but she didn’t get there&nbsp;— she got too weak and fainted. Suddenly, Jean fell and lost consciousness near her friend’s house.</p><p>Jean Hilliard was wearing a&nbsp;light winter coat, cowboy boots, and pants&nbsp;— so&nbsp;she wasn’t quite prepared for harsh weather conditions. There was a&nbsp;strong blizzard and snowfall outside, so&nbsp;no&nbsp;one noticed her. The friend Jean wanted to&nbsp;visit only saw the frozen girl near his porch in&nbsp;the morning. Jean Hilliard had been lying there for 6&nbsp;hours.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/00e/52b/3d772c56a4a5d2b80e5fd66e2f.png><p>Her body was hard and cold as&nbsp;if&nbsp;it&nbsp;was made of&nbsp;rubber. Her eyes looked as&nbsp;if&nbsp;they were made of&nbsp;glass. The man who noticed the girl was sure that she wasn’t alive. But then he&nbsp;saw bubbles of&nbsp;moisture from her nose. The girl was breathing! He&nbsp;got the girl to&nbsp;the hospital. Her body wouldn’t bend, so&nbsp;putting the girl in&nbsp;the car was problematic.</p><p>The doctors immediately rushed to&nbsp;help Jean, but it&nbsp;wasn’t that easy. They couldn’t even make any injections, as&nbsp;the needles would constantly break: the muscles were too stiff and frozen. Her body activated emergency mode and stopped supplying muscles and soft tissues with blood. All the red liquid was directed at&nbsp;the vital organs.</p><p>Also, in&nbsp;emergency mode, our organism can slow down all internal processes of&nbsp;the body. The heart starts pounding slower, the lungs consume less oxygen, and the metabolism nearly stops. Such energy savings helped the girl to&nbsp;survive. But the doctors were more surprised that Jean didn’t get any serious troubles.</p><p>She got frostbite, but the ice crystals didn’t destroy her skin and soft tissues. The doctors decided to&nbsp;warm the girl with a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;heating pads. Then, they finally managed to&nbsp;inject medications. A&nbsp;few hours later, she regained consciousness. The tests showed that Jean was in&nbsp;perfect health.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/4ea/fd1/c634b756998059772162a48e7b.png><p>Meanwhile, you can get into a&nbsp;severe trap not only in&nbsp;nature in&nbsp;bad weather. You can get stuck in&nbsp;an&nbsp;elevator in&nbsp;a&nbsp;building full of&nbsp;people in&nbsp;Manhattan, and no&nbsp;one will know about&nbsp;it. This happened in&nbsp;1999 with Nicholas White. The 34-year-old manager was working late in&nbsp;the office and decided to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;break. After getting some fresh air outside, Nicholas called the elevator to&nbsp;go&nbsp;back to&nbsp;the 43rd floor. But he&nbsp;got trapped in&nbsp;the elevator. It&nbsp;was already quite late, and almost all the workers had left the building.</p><p>But the worst thing was that it&nbsp;was Friday night. Nicholas had no&nbsp;phone, no&nbsp;food, and no&nbsp;water. He&nbsp;pressed the emergency call button, but no&nbsp;one answered him. The cameras worked perfectly, but the guards didn’t see him. The building was basically empty. Nicholas struggled with claustrophobia, walked from side to&nbsp;side, jumped, lay down, tried to&nbsp;open the doors, and waited for somebody to&nbsp;rescue him.</p><p>There were repair workers on&nbsp;the other floors, but they didn’t hear Nicholas. Also, his colleagues stayed in&nbsp;the office where he&nbsp;worked. They were sure that Nicholas had just gone home. They left the office using other elevators and did not notice that Nicholas had left his things on&nbsp;his desk. Nicholas was in&nbsp;despair. He&nbsp;was rescued 41&nbsp;hours later.</p><p>He&nbsp;was lying on&nbsp;the elevator floor, tormented by&nbsp;thirst, when he&nbsp;suddenly heard a&nbsp;voice from the elevator speaker. “Hey, is&nbsp;anyone there?” Rescuers got the man out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;metal box, and the building owners paid him compensation for the inconvenience. Despite this nightmare, Nicholas continued to&nbsp;use the elevators. Yeah, living in&nbsp;Manhattan, it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;problematic to&nbsp;avoid them. Certainly for Nicholas, life has its ups and downs....</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5uucCnZLCgn2LAtr7Voq2enF1neq67za2frGWkp66xvMSdZKKmXZ22tHnCmqlmcGFqfnl8jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
