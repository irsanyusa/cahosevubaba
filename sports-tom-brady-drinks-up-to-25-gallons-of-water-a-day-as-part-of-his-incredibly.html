On page 221, he describes how you can hydrate like a five-time Super Bowl Champion.</p><p>"TB12 is simple: Drink at least one-half of your body weight in ounces of water every day," he writes. "That's the minimum. Ideally, you'll drink more than that, and with added electrolytes, too. This makes sense, considering the composition of our bodies."</p><p>For the 225-pound Brady, that means a huge intake of water: around 112 ounces a day. But that doesn't always cut it, especially when his schedule is particularly strenuous. On those days, the longtime New England Patriot says he drinks up to 300 ounces of water, or around two-and-a-half gallons.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>To put that into context, an average drinking glass holds about eight ounces of liquid. That means Brady drinks over 37 standard glasses of water on a busy day, a staggering number.</p><p>Perhaps even more incredibly, Brady has strict rules for when and how he's allowed to drink his gallons. He adds his own brand of electrolytes to just about everything he drinks, and he likes to promote good digestion by waiting an hour after meals to pour his next glass. With all of that to keep in mind, it's a wonder he has the time to drink so much water, let alone the willingness.</p><p>To Brady, water is good for external beauty as well as internal health. On page 209, he cites his water consumption as the reason he rarely gets sunburned.</p><p>"These days, even if I get an adequate amount of sun, I wonâ€™t get a sunburn, which I credit to the amount of water I drink," he writes. "I always hydrate afterward, too, to keep my skin from peeling."</p><p>While Brady's book is a top seller on Amazon, he may have trouble convincing the local media of his diet's effectiveness. A nutritionist recently <a href=# id=d6c8c447-d99d-5959-a0b2-2c332197dfc9>told the Boston Globe</a> that she would "never recommend" the quarterback's suggested water intake to a patient.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p70qmmq6yjZMCxu9Gtqmasn6J6o77AnbBmnKKeu6y%2FjK6nZqyfYn92ecaao6Wnnqh6sLKMsJitnaJirm6wwLJkmqtdpa6zwIyonWagmah6qrrCq5ydoZKhxnC%2F0W2aammc</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
