This week we have four gems from TIME’s 100 Must-Read Books 📚 list, timely inspiration from Dolly, your weekly dose of human kindness, thoughts on holiday guilt, and a super-Zen comfort dog.<strong>🌞</strong></i></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>In my twenties, I was a selfish dope about Thanksgiving.</strong><b> </b>Instead of going home to my parents, there were a few years when I decided to spend the holiday with friends in some other city or country because it was easier or more fun. I thought of my mother and father as constants—like the ocean they lived near, or Mephista, the ancient and eternally outraged cat my father insisted was “too evil to die.” He pretended to despise her, but every morning he made two bowls of oatmeal with cream, one for her, one for him. And God help us, she ate her bowl on the counter right next to him.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Back when going home was just a bus ride, I didn’t understand what it meant to my parents to have the whole family around the table. And I really didn’t get the inevitable fragility of the generation before me till I had my own kids. That’s when you start to do the math about how long your children will have their grandparents.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">With my mom and dad and many aunts and uncles gone, l can say that time with beloved elders when they are still themselves goes so much faster than you think. Now the unspeakable toll of COVID-19 is making that equation brutally real to too many of us—including a lot of young people who are figuring it out way earlier than I did.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>When I hear young friends talk about getting tested and quarantining for weeks</strong> so they can spend Thanksgiving with their parents safely, I sink into a little puddle of regret. If my parents were still in that little <a href=# rel=noopener>Cape May</a> house, I’d corral my kids and have Thanksgiving dinner at a card table in their driveway wearing our parkas if we had to.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And like everyone, my heart cracks open when I think of the tens of thousands of people this year who are facing their first holiday after losing someone they loved to the virus, or who will be alone this year to avoid traveling.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So if you can’t be with your family, the one you inherited or the one you’ve chosen, when you get on that Zoom or FaceTime or speakerphone call during the holiday, ask your loved ones to tell the stories you’ve heard too many times. Then hit the RECORD button.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As we’re learning in this oh-so-difficult year, getting bored, lectured to, or teased in person by the ones you love is a luxury.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">💌 p.s.
