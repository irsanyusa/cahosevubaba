For those who desire a safe alternative to get rid of the scars left behind from pimples and acne, try some of these clever natural solutions.</p><p>Aloe vera gel is a fantastic remedy to get rid of acne scars.

It is composed of sodium bicarbonate crystals which gently exfoliate skin when used as a cleansing scrub.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-11>How to use it:</h2></p><p>Just mix a few teaspoons of baking soda with enough water to form a thick paste then massage into skin where scars are present. Once applied, you should leave the mixture on for a minute or two.</p><p>This will allow the soda to cleanse pores and help prevent further blemishes. After a couple of minutes, wash your face in lukewarm water and apply a good natural moisturizer like, jojoba, coconut, or olive oil.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Coconut oil is at the top of the list when it comes to natural moisturizers with healing properties.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-16>How to use it:</h2></p><p>Scoop about a quarter of a teaspoon of virgin coconut oil into the palm of your hand and let it melt as it comes up to body temperature. With your fingertips, massage oil directly onto scarred skin and let it soak in.</p><p>There is no need to wash coconut oil away as the vitamins and essential fatty acids will continue to work and improve skin health as long as you wear it. However, if the oil is too heavy for your comfort, leave it on for at least thirty minutes before removing with an all-natural cleanser.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Onions are an age old remedy for scars and they are even used in some commercial scar fading creams.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-21>How to use it:</h2></p><p>Simply apply onion juice to the affected area and leave it on for fifteen minutes, it will reduce inflammation and, over time, fade scar tissue.</p><p>Another natural moisturizer which can help heal scars is honey.

You can also mix about a teaspoon of ground cinnamon per two tablespoons of honey for added pore-cleansing power.

The juice contains citric acid which can neutralise and control the oil secretion of oily skin.</p><p>It has the capacity to reduce pimples effectively. The acid quite well works to kill the harmful acne causing bacteria along with reducing the scars.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-29>How to use it:</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Simply squeeze the juice from one organic lemon into a small bowl. You can use this treatment undiluted or mixed with water if you have sensitive skin. Dab juice over scars with a cotton ball and let it dry completely. Then rinse your face with cool water and follow up with a natural moisturizer. Repeat this treatment once every two or three days.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZK%2BmrdStsGaglZa5tbSObmSnmaSqv6K4jLCYsqtdqbxuvsSmpq%2BdXZe5oq%2FKZqqpp6SoeqLAjKGmpp1fo4Kvxtefng%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
