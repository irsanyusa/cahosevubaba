We’ve seen some pretty great contestants on this show, but I think we can all agree season 18 is seemingly the best of all. In tonight’s episode, Ariani Nisma Putri makes her AGT debut. Here’s everything to know about her.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Meet Blind Singer Ariani Nisma Putri aka Putri</h2><p>Some Got Talent fans may have recognized Ariani Nisma Putri, who prefers to be called Putri, since she’s already been on one competition before. In 2014, she competed on and won Indonesia’s Got Talent at only <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>8 years old</a>. At the time, it was reported that although the Yogyakarta, Indonesia native was born blind, she always had a superstar voice and a love for singing. Even though she can’t see, she wants others to see her.</p><p>In her viral IGT audition, Putri revealed that she was born prematurely after only six months of pregnancy. She then sang “Listen” by Beyonce. Although she was all of 8 years old at the time, she surely belted the song out like a pro. The judges each had tears in their eyes! This audition has 13 million views on YouTube today.</p><p>After judges complimented her “marvelous voice,” they called Putri’s parents on stage, to tell them how lucky they are. The judges then voted her into the next round of the competition, where she sang “Don’t You Remember” by Adele.</p><p>Following this performance, Putri made it into the Grand Final, and was later declared the winner of Indonesia’s Got Talent. Now, it seems as if Putri is aspiring to show her talent off to a larger audience in America.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-putri-s-life-after-indonesia-s-got-talent>Putri’s Life After <i>Indo</i>nesia’s Got Talent</h2><p>Following IGT, Putri went to compete on another talent show. In 2017, she competed on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Voice Kids Indonesia</a> season 2. She competed on this series at only 11 years old, making it on to Bebi Romeo’s team. Unfortunately, she got eliminated during the Sing Off round. Reportedly, around the same time, she was awarded a Baiduri Award as a child singer with national achievements.</p><p>In 2018, Putri sang “Song of Victory” at the 2018 Asian Para Games. Now, Putri is focusing on reaching a whole new level of fame. Since winning IGT, she released original music. In current day, she has released one album, and around 19 singles. Putri currently has over 298,000 followers on Instagram, 1.7 million followers on TikTok, and 438,000 subscribers on YouTube.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Outstanding Singer Earns Simon Cowell’s Golden Buzzer</h2><p>Now, Putri has made her debut on the show and earned one of the coveted Golden Buzzers of the season. After singing an unnamed original song, Simon Cowell asked her to sing another tune. In turn, she chose to sing “Sorry Seems to Be The Hardest Word” by Elton John. This song clearly impressed the judges just as much as her original tune.</p><p>After her impressive audition, Cowell hit the Golden Buzzer, noting that she has “glow about you.” What do you think of Putri on America’s Got Talent? Do you think her performance was Golden Buzzer worthy?
