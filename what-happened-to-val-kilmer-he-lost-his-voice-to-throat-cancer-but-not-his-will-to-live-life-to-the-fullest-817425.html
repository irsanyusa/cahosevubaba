The disease took away his ability to&nbsp;speak properly, and left him with life-changing sequelae. Still, the Hollywood veteran took an&nbsp;inspiring stand against all the challenges and became more creative than ever.</p><p><h2>His fight against cancer started out silently.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/54c/bb9/9ca7a753e38959c3ba88799ba2.jpg><p>He's still a very handsome man.</p><p>Wondering what happened to&nbsp;Val Kilmer is&nbsp;only natural. Known for iconic roles in&nbsp;films like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Top Gun</i></a><i> </i>(1986) and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Batman Forever</i></a><i> </i>(1995), he&nbsp;stepped away from the spotlight&nbsp;as, between 2015 and 2017, he&nbsp;privately grappled with a&nbsp;serious throat cancer diagnosis before publicly disclosing details about his <a href=# title=health data-link=tag>health</a>. In&nbsp;fact, early news of&nbsp;Kilmer’s condition came from fellow actor <a href=# title="Michael Douglas" data-link=tag>Michael Douglas</a>, unbeknownst to&nbsp;Kilmer himself. The revelation then prompted Kilmer to&nbsp;confirm his battle with cancer in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Reddit session in&nbsp;2017.</p><p>However, his first symptoms date back to&nbsp;2014, when he&nbsp;noticed a&nbsp;big lump in&nbsp;his throat. In&nbsp;his own memoir, <i>I’m Your Huckleberry</i>, Kilmer candidly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> one of&nbsp;the dramatic events that led him to&nbsp;discover his cancer. One night he&nbsp;woke up&nbsp;bleeding in&nbsp;his bed and immediately called emergency services. His hostess at&nbsp;the time was none other than <a href=# title=Cher data-link=tag>Cher</a>, a&nbsp;long-time <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>friend</a> of&nbsp;Kilmer, who gave him unconditional support during this critical moment in&nbsp;Kilmer’s health crisis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e07/91b/3c599b52cb846346149fcca2f6.jpg><p>Due to&nbsp;spiritual reasons, he&nbsp;was initially <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hesitant</a> to&nbsp;seek medical help. With time, his children, Jack and Mercedes Kilmer, finally convinced him to&nbsp;undergo treatment, leading to&nbsp;chemotherapy, radiation, and <a href=# title=surgery data-link=tag>surgery</a> for his diagnosed throat cancer, which thankfully <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>healed</a> quickly.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;sacrificed his voice to&nbsp;treat his cancer.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6c9/d54/17b8245e47b57adb7166277e86.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the 2021 biographical documentary <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Val</i></a>, Kilmer shared further insights into how having done a&nbsp;tracheostomy deeply altered his ability to&nbsp;communicate and impacted his potential involvement in&nbsp;future screen roles. The procedure, an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>incision</a> into the windpipe helps air and oxygen reach the lungs, went ahead after he&nbsp;was left to&nbsp;choose between breathing and eating.</p><p>The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>64-year-old</a> ended up&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>voiceless</a> after the surgery, only able to&nbsp;make minor sounds, like squeaks, and it&nbsp;left him with a&nbsp;tracheostomy tube and a&nbsp;feeding tube. To&nbsp;hide the scars, Kilmer is&nbsp;often seen wearing kerchiefs or&nbsp;scarves. But even though it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;difficult choice and with ever-present consequences, the actor guarantees he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sounds</a> much worse than he&nbsp;actually feels.</p><p>In&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a> on&nbsp;<i>Good Morning America</i>, he&nbsp;compared coping with the loss of&nbsp;his voice to&nbsp;learning a&nbsp;new language or&nbsp;dialect, emphasizing how he&nbsp;needs to&nbsp;figure out a&nbsp;unique way to&nbsp;communicate. Neverthless, Kilmer expressed a&nbsp;positive and determined attitude, and framed the situation as&nbsp;just another acting challenge that he&nbsp;is&nbsp;committed to&nbsp;overcoming.</p><p>So, what happened to&nbsp;Val Kilmer since his cancer entered the remission stage? Keep reading to&nbsp;find out.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;found solace in&nbsp;art and began using it&nbsp;as&nbsp;therapy.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4fd/0e0/a0529c57b5be54cbba37230a6e.jpg><p>Throughout his difficult journey of&nbsp;recovery, Kilmer turned to&nbsp;art as&nbsp;a&nbsp;form of&nbsp;communication and emotional healing. On&nbsp;his website, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>described</a> how losing his voice heightened his creativity, and he&nbsp;took up&nbsp;<a href=# title=painting data-link=tag>painting</a> and writing again. In&nbsp;2017, at&nbsp;the height of&nbsp;his battle with cancer, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>featured</a> his paintings in&nbsp;a&nbsp;New York exhibit, titled <i>Valholla</i>.</p><p>He&nbsp;went even further than just making art himself, though. He&nbsp;put together a&nbsp;virtual project, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Kamp Kilmer</a>, in&nbsp;which he&nbsp;aims to&nbsp;bring together artists from various artistic mediums and foster collaboration. Then, in&nbsp;2019, he&nbsp;stepped back into the spotlight to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>celebrate</a> an&nbsp;art exhibition at&nbsp;his Los Angeles studio.</p><p>But worry not, because this doesn’t mean returning to&nbsp;the big screens isn’t in&nbsp;his plans.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;wants to&nbsp;keep acting with the help of&nbsp;AI technology.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e40/605/2fed7e542cb9165de3e6dc0ada.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2022, Kilmer made a&nbsp;spectacular return to&nbsp;cinema by&nbsp;reprising one of&nbsp;his <i>Top Gun</i> role, as&nbsp;Tom “Iceman” Kazansky, in&nbsp;the sequel <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Top Gun: Maverick</i></a>. For the film, Tom Cruise and director Joseph Kosinski found a&nbsp;poignant way to&nbsp;incorporate Kilmer into the storyline, aligning his character’s narrative with the actor’s real-life challenges.</p><p>Utilizing AI&nbsp;technology, Kilmer’s voice was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recreated</a> from archival audio, allowing him to&nbsp;let his voice be&nbsp;heard again and deliver a&nbsp;heartfelt speech to&nbsp;his on-screen friend, Maverick, portrayed by&nbsp;Cruise. The AI&nbsp;process involved developing over forty models of&nbsp;Kilmer’s speech, and the selected recording, chosen for its quality and expressiveness, became an&nbsp;integral part of&nbsp;the film. Aditionally, Kilmer’s character, like the actor himself, also used a&nbsp;computer to&nbsp;communicate, adding a&nbsp;personal touch to&nbsp;the moment.</p><p>So, despite the challenges posed by&nbsp;his cancer treatment, Kilmer has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>emphasized</a> that he&nbsp;remains the same creative soul and that the&nbsp;AI reproduction of&nbsp;his own voice opens new doors for him in&nbsp;various aspects of&nbsp;his life, both personally and professionally. So&nbsp;much&nbsp;so, he&nbsp;said he’s open to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reprising</a> his role as&nbsp;Batman.</p><p>And we&nbsp;hope it&nbsp;works out because we’d love to&nbsp;see him again on-screen!</p><p>Unfortunately, what happened to&nbsp;Val Kilmer isn’t the first in&nbsp;Hollywood. Cancer has impacted the lives of&nbsp;other actors, including that of&nbsp;<i>Jurassic Park</i>’s Sam Neill. However, much like Kilmer, Neill hasn’t stopped <a href=#>the rare form of&nbsp;cancer he’s been battling since 2022</a> stop him from being positive about life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSprdNmn5qooJq7prCMraZmrpGheqy1y6acq2WYmnqtu9KtZKGho2LDsLXCnmStp12ptbO7wK1knJmemLKzecGuq2amn6l6qbXSZq6ipJxiwbB5y6KtnmWcnrOmedOoZK2glWKztrjLnqqtZWhmhHV%2BlGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
