Both men and women can sometimes be&nbsp;unhappy with the way their partners dress. If&nbsp;you are one of&nbsp;those people who want to&nbsp;elevate their boyfriend’s style, there are things you should know before making your partner throw away all his clothes.</p><p>Here at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side,</strong> we’ve collected some tips that will help you change your partner’s look for the better with love and tact.</p><p><h2>1. Plan a&nbsp;shopping trip for the 2&nbsp;of&nbsp;you.</h2></p><p>It’s not that easy to&nbsp;engage a&nbsp;man with shopping, so&nbsp;it’s better to&nbsp;<strong>limit it&nbsp;in&nbsp;time</strong> and <strong>visit only men’s departments</strong>. In&nbsp;this case, you will pay all your attention to&nbsp;your boyfriend’s wardrobe and avoid the temptation to&nbsp;pick up&nbsp;some clothes for yourself. Remember to&nbsp;be&nbsp;<a href=#>positive</a>: instead of&nbsp;saying that you hate your boyfriend’s T-shirt, tell him how attractive he&nbsp;would look in&nbsp;a&nbsp;smarter shirt.</p><p><h2>2. Strategically gift him clothing items and accessories.</h2></p><p>If&nbsp;your man hates shopping, don’t insist on&nbsp;it. Instead, buy him a&nbsp;clothing item you like and <a href=#>gift it</a>&nbsp;with some nice words. Tell him that when you saw that item in&nbsp;the store you thought of&nbsp;how great he&nbsp;would look in&nbsp;it&nbsp;and how happy it&nbsp;would make you feel. When purchasing that gift, make sure it&nbsp;<strong>matches your boyfriend’s personality</strong>, not yours.</p><p><h2>3. Invite him to&nbsp;an&nbsp;event he’ll have to&nbsp;dress up&nbsp;for.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5e2/dce/3fb2085bdfa188ce9e03081677.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you plan to&nbsp;elevate your boyfriend’s style, it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;logical to&nbsp;give him a&nbsp;<a href=#>reason to&nbsp;dress&nbsp;up</a>. Invite your man to&nbsp;dinner at&nbsp;a&nbsp;fancy restaurant, or&nbsp;plan an&nbsp;evening at&nbsp;the opera for the 2&nbsp;of&nbsp;you. In&nbsp;this case, your man will <strong>have no&nbsp;choice but to&nbsp;refuse his casual jeans and T-shirt</strong> and search for something more suitable (with your help, of&nbsp;course).</p><p><h2>4. Help him get rid of&nbsp;the clothes you don’t like.</h2></p><p>Before <a href=#>getting rid</a> of&nbsp;some old clothes in&nbsp;your man’s wardrobe, make sure you <strong>offer up&nbsp;new items as&nbsp;an&nbsp;alternative</strong>. Men don’t give up&nbsp;on&nbsp;their favorite clothes that easily, so&nbsp;you’ve got to&nbsp;interfere and help. You can use spring-cleaning as&nbsp;an&nbsp;opportunity to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through your partner’s wardrobe together and decide which items no&nbsp;longer fit him and can be&nbsp;donated or&nbsp;sold at&nbsp;a&nbsp;garage sale.</p><p><h2>5. Get him a&nbsp;tailored suit.</h2></p><p>What could be&nbsp;more flattering than a&nbsp;<a href=#>tailored suit</a> that fits like a&nbsp;glove? A&nbsp;bespoke suit is&nbsp;made to&nbsp;<strong>bring out strengths</strong> and <strong>minimize problem areas</strong> and it&nbsp;fits perfectly, which makes it&nbsp;a&nbsp;wise investment. A&nbsp;tailored suit might seem too expensive, but it&nbsp;will last for years and will bring pleasure to&nbsp;both of&nbsp;you in&nbsp;the long run.</p><p><h2>6. Focus on&nbsp;the fit.</h2></p><p><strong>A&nbsp;good fit is&nbsp;the key to&nbsp;success</strong>. Even a&nbsp;simple shirt and jeans that fit well will look much better than a&nbsp;poorly tailored suit. So, <a href=#>keep that in&nbsp;mind</a> when choosing clothes for your boyfriend in&nbsp;a&nbsp;store or&nbsp;when ordering a&nbsp;bespoke suit.</p><p><h2>7. Choose proper clothes for muscular men.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b2e/bf0/2ccdd55e9294085aab20869e51.jpg><p>Choosing the right clothes for a&nbsp;man with big muscles might be&nbsp;a&nbsp;challenge, and there are some <a href=#>rules</a> to&nbsp;follow if&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;succeed. It’s better to&nbsp;<strong>stick to&nbsp;neutral colors</strong> that don’t attract too much attention and to&nbsp;<strong>avoid clothes that add extra volume</strong> like cable knit sweaters and puffer coats. Slim-fit denim clothing and (again) tailored suits are good options.</p><p><h2>8. Don’t forget about the details.</h2></p><p><a href=#>Details</a> can sometimes change the whole look and they surely can’t be&nbsp;ignored. Cufflinks, tie bars, and pocket squares might seem too small to&nbsp;be&nbsp;noticed, but they <strong>give a&nbsp;finishing touch to&nbsp;the whole look</strong>. Shoes are also important. Sometimes men can’t put their shoes and clothes together, so&nbsp;when you pick up&nbsp;a&nbsp;new look for your boyfriend, make sure you pick out a&nbsp;<strong>nice pair of&nbsp;shoes to&nbsp;match that look</strong>.</p><p><h2>9. Compliment your partner’s choice of&nbsp;clothes.</h2></p><p>Don’t forget to&nbsp;<a href=#>compliment</a> your man’s taste when he&nbsp;wears clothes that you think look nice on&nbsp;him. <strong>Positive reinforcement and words of&nbsp;encouragement</strong> are the most important when you want another person to&nbsp;change their habits. Remember the golden rule: treat others the way you’d want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;treated.</p><p><h2>10. Be&nbsp;tactful.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b92/971/936cdc57568c67576b110eeb85.jpg><p>Don’t be&nbsp;pushy and <strong>don’t impose your taste</strong> on&nbsp;your boyfriend if&nbsp;he&nbsp;doesn’t like your choice of&nbsp;clothes for him. Try to&nbsp;pick up&nbsp;looks that match your partner’s personality and taste, not yours. Before suggesting any changes, try to&nbsp;<a href=#>find out</a> why he&nbsp;chooses to&nbsp;wear particular pieces. If&nbsp;your man values comfort, try to&nbsp;show him in&nbsp;a&nbsp;tactful and respectful way that nicer clothes can be&nbsp;just as&nbsp;comfortable.</p><p>Which of&nbsp;these hacks seems most effective?
