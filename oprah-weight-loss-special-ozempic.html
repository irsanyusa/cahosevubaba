On March 18, they got another major cultural boost from Oprah Winfrey, who shared her own experience with—and support for—these medications in an ABC special called “Shame, Blame and the Weight Loss Revolution.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">During the special, Winfrey talked about how using one of these weight-loss drugs (she did not say which) changed her life and opened her eyes to the reality that obesity is a disease, rather than a choice. “All these years, I thought all of the people who never had to diet were just using their willpower, and they were for some reason stronger than me,” Winfrey said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After taking medication, however, she realized that she thought about food differently than people who had no trouble keeping weight off. Her brain was working against her. "You weren't thinking about the food! You weren't obsessing about it!" she said. “That is the big thing I learned."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The special, which will be available on Hulu starting March 19, spotlights a class of drugs known as GLP-1 agonists, which mimic a hormone that suppresses appetite and controls blood sugar, helping some patients <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">lose roughly 20% of their body weight</a>. These medications include Ozempic and Mounjaro (which are approved to treat Type 2 diabetes, but are also used off-label for weight loss) and Wegovy and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Zepbound</a> (which are approved as anti-obesity medications).</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">About three-quarters of Americans say they’re familiar with these drugs, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recent polling data from Pew Research Center show</a>, and that number will likely rise even more after Winfrey’s special. At times, that felt like the program’s whole aim. Winfrey interviewed people who have lost large amounts of weight on GLP-1 drugs, along with executives and paid medical consultants from the pharmaceutical companies that make them. (Ozempic and Wegovy are made by Novo Nordisk, while Mounjaro and Zepbound are made by Eli Lilly.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Should We End Obesity?</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Making a television special about these drugs was so important to Winfrey that in February, she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">announced she would leave WeightWatchers’ board</a> and donate her company stock to the National Museum of African American History and Culture, in part to “eliminate any perceived conflict of interest” since <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WeightWatchers now embraces anti-obesity medications</a> and even started a program to prescribe them. The company’s CEO, Sima Sistani, was interviewed about that shift on Winfrey’s special. “We are the most clinically tested, evidence-based, science-backed behavior-change program, but we were missing the third prong, which was biology,” Sistani said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Even as drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound soar in popularity, however, skepticism remains about their widespread use, particularly among people who just want to drop a few pounds. In the February Pew poll, 62% of respondents said these medications are not good options for those who do not have a weight-related health problem—a view shared by some physicians, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">who argue weight loss is not always medically necessary.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Even for people who do have weight-associated health conditions, GLP-1 drugs can come with side effects, including gastrointestinal distress, headaches, pancreatitis, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">obstructions of the digestive system</a>. Some researchers have also raised concerns that they may <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">contribute to an elevated risk of thyroid cancer.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More</strong>: <a href=#>For People with Eating Disorders, the Buzz About Ozempic Is a Nightmare</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Winfrey’s special, Dr. Amanda Velazquez, a weight-loss specialist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and a paid consultant for pharmaceutical companies that make weight-loss medications, called side effects “over-hyped,” noting that they’re “mild to moderate in the research studies.”<br>But other research suggests GLP-1 side effects are bad enough that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a significant portion of patients stop using them</a>, which typically results in gaining back much of the weight they lost. In the special, Velazquez acknowledged that people will likely have to take these drugs their entire lives to maintain their weight loss.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As she closed her special, Winfrey said weight-loss drugs are not for everyone, and that some people may choose not to lose weight or to do so with diet and exercise. But “for the people who think that this could be the relief and support and freedom…that you’ve been looking for your whole life,” she said, “bless you.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWVtf3OAjqinq5mYYsSmtcahq2akn6jAbr%2FPnpqimZxivLuxzKmgnGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
