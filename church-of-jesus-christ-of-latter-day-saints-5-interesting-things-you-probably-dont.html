First of all, it is actually a church. Still, this is understandable which is why we shedding some light on this church.</p><p>Here are five interesting things you probably don't know about Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p><p>They are Christians</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Due to the fact that not enough is known about this church, many people assume that members are not Christians. Some go as far as calling the organization a cult.</p><p>Contrary to these public opinions, they are actually Christians because they believe and worship God in the name of Jesus Christ.</p><p>According to the founder of the movement, Joseph Smith, they are Christians because they put Christ at the centre.</p><p>In his words, “The fundamental principles of our religion is the testimony of the apostles and prophets concerning Jesus Christ, ‘that he died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended up into heaven;’ and all other things are only appendages to these, which pertain to our religion.”</p><p>They have two names</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Formally, this religious body is known as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or the LDS Church.</p><p>Informally, it is called the Mormon Church. <a href=# id=8fc0c09d-0267-5a25-a9cb-3a0b162d3253>Members</a> are referred to as Latter-day Saints or Mormons, according to Wikipedia. This is because church follows the Book of Mormon.</p><p>The church was started by one man’s vision</p><p>The birth of this church can be traced to Joseph Smith, the first president who established the church on April 6, 1830.</p><p>He is believed to have been called by God to be a prophet. He is likened to Moses and Abraham from the Bible. Like these prophets, Smith saw God the Father and Jesus Christ. He saw them in a vision after praying for a church to join.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>According to the church’s official site, he was given a mandate—to restore the church organized by Christ himself during His time on earth. This explains the original name of the church, the Church of Christ.</p><p>Prior to the establishment of the church in 1830, he was also visited by angels John the Baptist, Peter, James, and John in 1829, who came to give him the priesthood authority needed to reestablish the Church of Christ.</p><p>This name was officially changed in 1838 to what it is now known as after a divine revelation from God to Smith.</p><p>Before this official change, the church was referred to as the “Church of the Latter Day Saints” in early church publications in 1834.</p><p>Smith continued his mission until his death on June 27,&nbsp; 1844.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The church has its own sacred text</p><p>The church uses the Book of Mormon which is believed to be the writings of ancient American prophets. Smith published it in March 1830 as 'The Book of Mormon: An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon upon Plates Taken from the Plates of Nephi.'</p><p>It is also known as “another testament of Jesus Christ”, this subtitle was added in 1982.</p><p>The Book of Mormon is believed to deal with issues like life after death, the purpose of life, happiness, sin, repentance and so on.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The church has unique beliefs.</p><p>Majority of Mormons see their church as the “one true church of Christ,” with the “restored gospel of Christ.”</p><p>They see God as part of a “Godhead”, which includes God the Father, Christ, His Son and the Holy Spirit. These three are seen as separate entities with one united purpose.</p><p>For this church, God has a wife called the Heavenly Mother. She lives in Heaven with Him. They also believe that “exalted” Mormons become God-like in heaven after death.</p><p>In general, they believe in reincarnation, the afterlife, free will, salvation, and compulsory baptism at age 8. They also kick against taking alcohol, tobacco or drinking tea and coffee.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>This church may have started with six original members but now, it has grown to a membership of over 15 million people across six continents.</p><p>In Nigeria, there are at least 152,903 members,&nbsp; 19 districts, 500 congregations, six missions, and only one temple.</p><p>This temple is in Aba. It was announced on April 2, 2000, and dedicated by Gordon B. Hinckley on August 7, 2005.</p><p>Here, the Book of Mormon has been translated into Nigerian several languages including Ibo and Efik.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksLC5zK6loqyZmsBwvsSloKChn6N8pLTUq5qhZZ%2Bbequx0q6qZpuYp7a0wIyonWakkanBpr6MnZiyZaOWtq%2FA0mZsZqGeqbKzsdKtoKefXam1qrrGrGSyp6VivbO7wZqZpbFdmbyvwI6wp6WgnJ%2BC</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
