(FYI: Gab's sporting the Dawn in brown quartz, which is still available for <a href=# id=4072175c-24d0-3a93-ade6-eaa022b01d1f>$178 for the whole set</a> .). She captioned the photo, "Relaxed. Refreshed. Refocused," and it definitely shows.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>But she didn't stop there. On Thursday morning, Gabrielle shared a bright neon-green look, sharing more of her smokin' body, and posing in front of a very envy-inducing background</p><p>If the whole look's got you green with envy, you can find it at <a href=# id=9378a695-406c-3c65-a711-8546aa3187ab>Frankii Swim</a> ; while <a href=# id=e3e0b602-462f-35ad-a8a6-6852a573ddaf>the exact version Gabrielle</a> is wearing appears to be sold out, the retailer sells a ton of similar tops and bottoms that are honestly just as beach-worthy.</p><p>But let's face it: While Gab's bikinis are wish-list material, her body's the main focus of her Instagram photos-and it's largely thanks to her pilates routine. Gabrielle previously told <a href=# id=21cf4561-1bb2-38b7-a7ff-ccae70087658>Womens Health</a> that the exercise helps her get over her hatred for morning workouts (#relatable). The great thing about Pilates is that I can take out my annoyance from waking up early on the machines instead of human beings, she said. It's for the greater good. My body responds to it, and I'm also more clear."</p><p>As for still looking like she did in her Bring It On days, Gabrielle has a pretty notable self-care routine. "My best anti-aging tip is the ability to say 'no, no, and hell, no,'" she said, noting that she doesn't smoke and also knows her boundaries. "We run ourselves ragged saying yes to every freaking thing, whether it's to our family, spouses, or careers. I sleep eight hours a day and don't let myself stress out. A lot of people call it selfish, but I don't have any wrinkles."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Clearly, stress-free looks good on her. Hey Gab, got any extra room on that boat?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZMSwucSnqmaglZa5tbSOoJibqpmaua2xjK6loqeeYrimsc%2BsZKygn6y2r7OMqJ2fZZiav26twaxkmqaUYrmms9JmoKdlkp64qrrIZqehp6SkwKK6w2agZpmdYrWmvsRmnaiqX5jGeILGpGo%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
