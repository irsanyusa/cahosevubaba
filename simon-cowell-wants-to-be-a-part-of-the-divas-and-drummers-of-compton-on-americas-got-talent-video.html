But one act, in particular, that is vying for the win also may have just gotten a new member. After seeing the Divas and Drummers of Compton perform, Simon Cowell became their biggest fan.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Divas And Drummers Of Compton Slayed Their Performance On ‘AGT’</h2><p>The leader of the group, Kehli Berry said that after graduating college she decided to come back to her hometown of Compton, California. She wants to provide the kids with an opportunity to use the performing arts as a tool to help change their lives for the better. This group is comprised of 25 members ranging from the ages of three to 20. The goal is to give all of the kids in the group the opportunity to go to college. The audience felt this was super admirable and could not wait to see their act. Perhaps the most adorable part is the little boy Matty who is only three years old beaming with joy as he gets ready to play his drums for the world to see.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>‘AGT’ AUDITIONS: Simon Cowell CALLS A CONTESTANT’S MOM AND HAS AN EMOTIONAL CHAT [VIDEO]</a></strong></p><p>Their memorable performance featured acrobatics, dancing and of course drumming. The Divas and Drummers of Compton really utilized the stage well and had the perfect combinations of flips and tricks to whoo the crowd. Everyone was on their feet after this group brought contagious energy to the stage. The very end of the performance made a huge bang, literally and you can see Matty peeking out from behind the curtain when it was over. It was pretty adorable, we can all agree. The fact that ‘AGT’ can bring someone who is just three years old to the stage and showcase their talents to the whole world is an amazing platform and experience to be a part of.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Simon Loves This Act And Wants To Be A Part Of It</h3><p>Simon was a huge fan of this performance. He said “I loved every single part of that audition. It had to be so synchronized, so the amount of work you must have put into it. It was fantastic.” But the most memorable thing that he said was that he wants to join the group and be a part of the act. What does Simon want to do in the group? Play the drums of course! One of the drummers from the group even offered Simon a spot on the team as a drummer right then and there.</p><p>What will it take for Simon to take the stage with a huge drum and give us the beats we deserve? Here’s to hoping we get to see this soon. Not to mention that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# class=broken_link>Howie Mandel</a> said that other kids will see this audition and will be so inspired to pursue a talent like this.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B9uidjgAfql/</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WHO IS ROBERTA BATTAGLIA? 5 FACTS ABOUT CHILD CANADIAN PRODIGY ON ‘AMERICA’S GOT TALENT’</a></strong></p><p>We can’t wait to see what the Divas and Drummers of Compton do in the next round of America’s Got Talent.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Suga-BTS-Agust-D-Daechwita.jpeg alt="Suga From BTS Is The FIRST KOREAN ARTIST To Have A No. 1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>simon cowell</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570qKkqKZdmLy4sculZLCZnqnAbsDOZpmeZZFivaK%2B02amn2WknbJusMivmKxlkaOxbrDRrqSmnaKoerCyjJympqikpLtuu81mmKadop6wor%2BMoKatZaSWuaa602atopyVpHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
