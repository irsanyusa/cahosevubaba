Outside of the election campaign Corbyn has been on similar numbers for most of 2019, achieving an all-time low of -56 at the end of July.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Corbyn’s reputation has suffered most among Labour voters. While the leader of the opposition had a net score of +39 among those who voted for his party in 2017, it has now fallen to -9.</p><h4><strong>Jo Swinson’s ratings also take a hit, although much of the movement comes from non-Lib Dem voters</strong></h4><p>Jo Swinson’s reputation was another casualty of the campaign. The Lib Dem leader has seen her score fall from -31 last week to -44. An article we published ahead of the election highlighted how <a href=#>Swinson seemed to become less popular the more the public got to know her</a>.</p><p>While the Lib Dem leader’s reputation has taken a knock among those who backed the party in 2017 – going from +24 to +15 – it is worth noting that the proportion with a positive opinion of her has remained the same at 54%, compared to 53% ahead of the ballot.</p><p>Her declining favourability figures among Lib Dem voters instead come from people moving from don’t know (down to 7% from 18%) to holding an unfavourable view (up from 29% to 39%).</p><p>Opinion of Swinson has actually fallen more sharply among Conservative and Labour voters. While the Lib Dem leader had a net score of -18 among 2017 Labour voters prior to the election, it has since fallen to -39, and among Tory voters the decline has been from -52 to -65.</p><h4><strong>Boris Johnson sees no benefit to his ratings for winning the election</strong></h4><p>While there has clearly been a popularity penalty for losing the election, there appears to be no contrasting dividend for winning it. Boris Johnson’s net favourability remains effectively unchanged, having been on -12 just prior to the vote compared to -11 now, with 41% holding a positive view of the PM and 52% a negative one.</p><p>Even among 2017 Conservative voters the figures remain remarkably resilient. Eight in ten (79%) had a favourable view of Johnson and 18% a negative one during the 9th and 10th of December; those figures are now 81% and 17% respectively.</p><p>Photo: Getty</p><p><a href=#><strong>See the full results here</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYmuGc4KMnKarmqmjeqet1aisq5mSnrmqwNhmp6WtnaKytb%2BMm5ico12auaav06Kmp2WUmrOmrdM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
