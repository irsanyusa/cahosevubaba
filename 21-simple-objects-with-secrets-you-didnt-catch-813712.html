But this color wasn’t always a&nbsp;favorite. In&nbsp;fact, colored toilet paper popped out on&nbsp;the shelves in&nbsp;the 1950s. Homeowners purchased pink, blue, yellow, green, and even black paper because these colors matched the interior.</p><p>But eventually, many doctors began to&nbsp;associate the dye in&nbsp;colored toilet papers with increased health risks. Also, the dye didn’t allow the colored paper to&nbsp;decompose as&nbsp;quickly when it&nbsp;was flushed down, which increased the risk of&nbsp;clogging septic tanks. This made manufacturing and retail prices too high compared to&nbsp;the basic white paper. And eventually, the demand began to&nbsp;fall.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/250/cf8/dc050054f49f95ee6cd213628f.jpeg><p>And now let’s take a&nbsp;closer look at&nbsp;these fancy patterns. Most people probably don’t care about the decorations when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;their toilet paper. However, these patterns still exist. But why? Well, there are several opinions.</p><p>Some say it’s just a&nbsp;marketing tool. Manufacturers use pretty decor to&nbsp;make their products look more aesthetically pleasing. And to&nbsp;make customers associate their brand with elegance and a&nbsp;luxurious lifestyle. Another explanation is&nbsp;more practical. These patterns fluff up&nbsp;the paper which makes it&nbsp;more absorbent.</p><p>Speaking of&nbsp;fluffiness, have you ever wondered why they have such rough toilet paper in&nbsp;public toilets? The most obvious answer is&nbsp;that high-quality toilet paper is&nbsp;more expensive. Also, companies prefer purchasing giant rolls of&nbsp;low-quality paper because they can change them less frequently. This decision also helps prevent stealing. Yes, people actually steal paper from public toilets.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/234/69a/7a512054b4bacfb035e09b091a.jpeg><p>Have you ever noticed that light switches in&nbsp;public toilets are usually placed outside? Well... It’s not a&nbsp;coincidence. Construction companies do&nbsp;it&nbsp;for safety reasons because, as&nbsp;we&nbsp;all know, electricity plus <a href=# title=water data-link=tag>water</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;dangerous combination. And light switches are connected to&nbsp;power, therefore electricity literally flows through them. Of&nbsp;course, professionally installed switches will have a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;additional safety precautions. But most builders prefer not to&nbsp;take risks.</p><p>The U.K. has far stricter rules for light switch safety compared to&nbsp;the U.S. That’s why if&nbsp;you live in&nbsp;London, you’ll probably find light switches outside the bathroom more commonly. But don’t worry, most bathrooms in&nbsp;the U.S. feature independent electrical circuits. This provides additional safety in&nbsp;case of&nbsp;accidental electric shock. When any change in&nbsp;the electrical current happens they should just shut off automatically.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/7dc/6b2/23a6a859679f553ebabdcf8661.jpeg><p>There are so&nbsp;many awesome lighting opportunities in&nbsp;this world. But why are the traffic lights red, green, and yellow? Turns out, there’s a&nbsp;reasonable explanation for&nbsp;it. Before traffic lights for cars, there were traffic signals for trains. And first railroad operators used white color to&nbsp;mean&nbsp;go, red to&nbsp;mean stop, and green to&nbsp;mean caution.</p><p>But later they realized that white wasn’t such a&nbsp;good idea, because bright white light could easily be&nbsp;mistaken for stars during the nighttime. So, railway companies changed the white color for green to&nbsp;mean&nbsp;go, and yellow to&nbsp;mean caution, because these colors are easily distinguishable from the others. And eventually, this tradition spread to&nbsp;traffic lights for cars and became a&nbsp;standard.</p><p>As&nbsp;for the red color, it&nbsp;has the longest wavelength, which means that drivers can see it&nbsp;from a&nbsp;greater distance than other colors. And the color yellow was chosen as&nbsp;a&nbsp;caution sign because it&nbsp;has a&nbsp;slightly shorter wavelength than red, but still longer than green.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/396/3a0/8d7f3d5b00a34ae9a319effb72.jpeg><p>What’s the dustiest room in&nbsp;your house? Usually, the answer is&nbsp;a&nbsp;bedroom. But why? Bedrooms tend to&nbsp;generate dust from skin cells, dust mites, and fibers from fabrics in&nbsp;your bed sheets, carpets, and curtains. If&nbsp;you have a&nbsp;pet, its fur and skin cells add a&nbsp;significant amount of&nbsp;dirt to&nbsp;this dusty party.</p><p>Luckily, there are simple ways to&nbsp;make your bedroom less dusty. This includes making your bed every day and cleaning the area regularly with both a&nbsp;vacuum cleaner and water. You can try to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;carpets, and unnecessary furniture and decor items that tend to&nbsp;collect dust. Also, pay attention to&nbsp;the quality when you buy curtains or&nbsp;bedsheets&nbsp;— the looser the fabric, the more it&nbsp;collects dirt. And finally, you can ban your pet from entering the bedroom... but let’s be&nbsp;honest&nbsp;— you would never do&nbsp;that!</p><p>Modern air purifiers, air conditioners, and ceiling fans can help make your sleeping area cozier. But make sure to&nbsp;clean them regularly. Otherwise, if&nbsp;your filter is&nbsp;dirty or&nbsp;clogged up&nbsp;with fur, or&nbsp;any other air pollutants, it&nbsp;won’t collect new dust properly. And the dust would end up&nbsp;on&nbsp;your bedroom’s surfaces.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/9ed/58f/e4e64152fb8f848a1da086c9c8.jpeg><p>Speaking of&nbsp;dust, did you know that you can clean the edge of&nbsp;a&nbsp;broom with a&nbsp;dustpan? This zigzag over here is&nbsp;not only for aesthetic purposes. You can use it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;comb for the bristles.</p><p>Have you ever had these marks behind your ears after wearing your <a href=# title=glasses data-link=tag>glasses</a>? Sometimes it&nbsp;can even take them weeks to&nbsp;go&nbsp;away. Well, it’s a&nbsp;sign that the side pieces of&nbsp;the glasses&nbsp;— called temples&nbsp;— are not adjusted properly for your head. In&nbsp;other words, they are too tight.</p><p>This can cause skin irritation and even headaches. If&nbsp;they are bent toward the area behind your ears, they can press on&nbsp;the fragile part of&nbsp;the skull. So, keep in&nbsp;mind that temples should not only have the correct size, but also the correct adjustment. A&nbsp;professional optician can easily fix this problem. It’s way safer than trying to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;on&nbsp;your own.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/dc6/31d/5aa22d5f04906daddb12555b61.jpeg><p>Box graters can be&nbsp;used in&nbsp;a&nbsp;horizontal position too. In&nbsp;many cases, it’s much more convenient to&nbsp;grate a&nbsp;carrot or&nbsp;a&nbsp;big block of&nbsp;<a href=# title=cheese data-link=tag>cheese</a> this way. If&nbsp;you wanna grate a&nbsp;soft product like goat cheese or&nbsp;mozzarella, you can put them in&nbsp;a&nbsp;freezer for about 30&nbsp;minutes before grating. Also, there’s a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;make the cleanup easier and prevent the cheese from sticking. Spray the grater with a&nbsp;small amount of&nbsp;<a href=# title=oil data-link=tag>oil</a> before using&nbsp;it.</p><p>And now let’s take a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;the most unpopular sides of&nbsp;the box grater. Have you ever used them? This side is&nbsp;actually designed for slicing. It’s pretty handy if&nbsp;you wanna make thin vegetable slices for your salad or&nbsp;pasta, or&nbsp;slice potato chips. And these tiny punched-out holes are designed for zesting or&nbsp;very finely grating.</p><p>Graters are pretty useful for the next non-food tip. If&nbsp;you’re on&nbsp;a&nbsp;budget, you can purchase this super cheap laundry soap, grate a&nbsp;small amount and throw it&nbsp;right into your washing machine instead of&nbsp;using the regular washing gel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/997/6cb/860a49509fa7c5071d8f7a2bd0.jpeg><p>Did you know that you can change which way the refrigerator opens the door? There are hinges over here&nbsp;— if&nbsp;you attach them on&nbsp;the other side, the doors will swing the other way. But before trying to&nbsp;do&nbsp;any repairs by&nbsp;yourself, make sure to&nbsp;disconnect the power source and read the instructions for your particular model of&nbsp;fridge.</p><p>Have you ever noticed that there’s a&nbsp;shiny side and a&nbsp;dull side to&nbsp;tin foil? Many people believe that it&nbsp;matters which side is&nbsp;used up&nbsp;or&nbsp;down because the shiny side should trap the heat better. But in&nbsp;fact, it&nbsp;makes no&nbsp;difference at&nbsp;all. The manufacturing process makes the 2&nbsp;sides look slightly different. But they both serve their purpose equally.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/de5/da0/717da15fc6863b3f94e9749d87.jpeg><p>Tin foil can be&nbsp;useful not only in&nbsp;the kitchen&nbsp;— here’s a&nbsp;little-known battery trick. Let’s say you’re out of&nbsp;AA batteries. No&nbsp;worries, use a&nbsp;smaller AAA battery and a&nbsp;small bit of&nbsp;tin foil. Just insert it&nbsp;on&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the ends. This will work because both&nbsp;AA and AAA batteries carry the same amount of&nbsp;voltage.</p><p>Did you know that Chinese take-out food containers can unfold and turn into plates? All you have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;is&nbsp;just to&nbsp;disassemble it&nbsp;from the 2&nbsp;sides, and gravitation will do&nbsp;the rest. By&nbsp;the way, the old-school name for this type of&nbsp;paperboard container is&nbsp;an&nbsp;oyster pail, because it&nbsp;was originally designed to&nbsp;hold oysters.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH9yedKipKmklWK8o7bEnKusZaeewal50p6aq52kqHq6u9Rmm6Kcnql6pK3TnJ9mcGFohHJ%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
