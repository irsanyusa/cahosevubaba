In&nbsp;fact, this is&nbsp;an&nbsp;everyday issue for her, since so&nbsp;many people have an&nbsp;opinion about her and make assumptions about what she eats. And even though she’s talked about this level of&nbsp;shaming, things don’t seem to&nbsp;be&nbsp;getting any better. Once again, she took to&nbsp;her social media and talked about how harmful these comments are for her.</p><p><h2>One person tweeted a&nbsp;video of&nbsp;her performing.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/94b/5ba/de9f1351be8c5251f841bf2c4f.jpg><p>That same person <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a> about the video “How is&nbsp;Lizzo still THIS fat when she’s constantly moving this much on&nbsp;stage?! <strong>I&nbsp;wonder what she must be&nbsp;eating.</strong>” It&nbsp;didn’t take long until other people started commenting in&nbsp;the same negative way, with one of&nbsp;them saying that she must be&nbsp;eating a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;fast food. All these comments were too much for Lizzo to&nbsp;bear, and she had to&nbsp;say something about them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/13e/1ad/db04a45d96bbbe1c4b1cc85c68.jpg><p>“I&nbsp;JUST logged on&nbsp;this app and this is&nbsp;the type of&nbsp;nonsense&nbsp;I see about me&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;daily basis. It’s really starting to&nbsp;make me&nbsp;hate the world.” And to&nbsp;the person who thinks she eats too much junk food, she replied, “<strong>I&nbsp;LITERALLY STOPPED EATING FAST FOOD YEARS AGO.</strong>” She continued by&nbsp;saying that she was really tired of&nbsp;always trying to&nbsp;explain herself and seeing her name being included in&nbsp;these awful conversations.</p><p><h2>She made it&nbsp;clear that she is&nbsp;not trying to&nbsp;change her body.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/05d/58d/3d74ee5b9db2fc56258f1b8f49.jpg><p>One other <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>comment</a> read, “I&nbsp;don’t think Lizzie wants to&nbsp;be&nbsp;smaller...yet...if she did, she would&nbsp;be. It’s her brand. If&nbsp;she’s working with nutritionists, they’re probably showing her how to&nbsp;eat healthy and maintain her size.”</p><p>Even though this one was one of&nbsp;the least hateful comments, Lizzo still felt the need to&nbsp;explain herself. “<strong>I’m not trying to&nbsp;BE fat. I’m not trying to&nbsp;BE smaller.</strong> I’m literally just trying to&nbsp;live and be&nbsp;healthy. This is&nbsp;what my&nbsp;body looks like even when I’m eating super clean and working out!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d50/965/adf8655cdf9fb071f2e4dad169.jpg><p>She continued tweeting about the matter showing how extremely sick and tired she is&nbsp;about people talking about her. “Y’all speak on&nbsp;things y’all know NOTHING ABOUT, and I’m starting to&nbsp;get heated. <strong>I&nbsp;HATE IT&nbsp;HERE.</strong> Y’all don’t know how close I&nbsp;be to&nbsp;giving up&nbsp;on&nbsp;everyone and quitting and enjoying my&nbsp;money and my&nbsp;man on&nbsp;a&nbsp;FARM.”</p><p><h2>This is&nbsp;not the first time she’s spoken about body shaming.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/60c/5bc/344c425f0c858e5fc3487b1781.jpg><p>Earlier in&nbsp;2023, the singer went on&nbsp;TikTok to&nbsp;talk once again about the various forms of&nbsp;body shaming that she is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>experiencing</a>. “The discourse around bodies is&nbsp;officially tired. I&nbsp;have seen comments go&nbsp;from ’Oh my&nbsp;gosh, I&nbsp;liked you when you were thick. Why did you lose weight?’ to ’Oh my&nbsp;gosh, you’re so&nbsp;big’ or ’You need to&nbsp;lose weight, but for your health.’ Do&nbsp;you see the delusion?”</p><p>She continued by&nbsp;saying, “<strong>Do&nbsp;we&nbsp;realize that artists are not here to&nbsp;fit into your beauty standards?</strong> Artists are here to&nbsp;make <a href=# title=art data-link=tag>art</a>, and this body is&nbsp;art, and I’m gonna do&nbsp;whatever&nbsp;I want with this body. I&nbsp;wish that comments costed y’all money, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;can see how much time we&nbsp;are wasting on&nbsp;the wrong thing.”</p><p>Lizzo has had a&nbsp;tremendous life story, and she doesn’t feel the need to&nbsp;make anyone <a href=#>happy</a> by&nbsp;making herself miserable. She is&nbsp;clear about <a href=#>liking her size</a> and not wanting to&nbsp;change&nbsp;it, and we&nbsp;honestly just <a href=# title=respect data-link=tag>respect</a> that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLmqxtmoZKyZqah6tLTErGStoaKasW67xWaqnp2Zo7RurculZK2glWK%2FtrDEZpqopZ2au7W%2FjJqZqK2kYrWmvoybpp2xXZa7pXnHmqpmmV2lvLix0Z%2BspWWdmsC0rcaeZK2nXai1or7EZm9qa2VphHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
