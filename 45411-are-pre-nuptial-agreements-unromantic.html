But what does the British public make of them?</p><p>Britons are more likely to see pre-nuptial agreements as a good idea (42%) than a bad one (13%). Another 25% see them as neither good nor bad, with the remaining 20% unsure.</p><p>Given that pre-nuptial agreements are most stereotypically associated with wealthy men trying to prevent their wives from taking a substantial portion of their fortune upon divorce, it is perhaps surprising to see that women are noticeably more likely to see pre-nups as a good idea (47%) than men (38%).</p><p>Younger Britons are also more likely to see them as an actively good idea than their elders: 46-47% of the under-50 age groups say so, compared to 37% aged 65 and above. Older Britons are more likely to see them in neutral terms (29% of the over-50 age groups say they are neither good nor bad) than younger Britons.</p><h3>How many Britons would prefer to get a pre-nuptial agreement?</h3><p>Despite 42% of Britons seeing pre-nups as a good idea, only around half as many (22%) say that if they were getting married for the first time now they would prefer to have a pre-nuptial agreement.</p><p>By contrast, four in ten (42%) say they would prefer not to get a pre-nup – a further 22% are unsure and 14% say they never want to get married in the first place.</p><p>Younger people are more willing to say they would prefer a pre-nup than their elders, mirroring their increased belief that they are a good idea. Yet despite women being more likely to see them as a good idea than men, there is not a gender divide at the top line, with 22% of men and 23% of women saying they would prefer one.</p><p>However, when you break the gender results down by income, a pattern emerges. Women become somewhat more likely to say they would prefer a pre-nuptial agreement the more money they earn: while 20% of women earning under £20,000 a year say they would prefer to get a pre-nuptial agreement, this rises to 32% of those earning £60,000 a year or more.</p><p>By contrast, the most money a man earns the more likely they are to say they would prefer not to have a pre-nup. While 37% of men earning less than £20,000 a year say they want a pre-nuptial agreement, this rises to 53% of those making £40,000-59,999 a year, and 52% of those earning £60,000 a year or more.</p><h3>Do people think pre-nupital agreements are unromantic?</h3><p>But is asking for a pre-nup a distinctly unromantic thing to do? How would Britons feel if their intended was to ask them to sign one?</p><p>Three in ten (31%) say that their fiancée asking for a pre-nup would make them feel worse about their relationship, including 10% who say they would feel “much worse” about it.</p><p>A similar number (29%) say it wouldn’t make a difference, with most of the rest unsure (22%).</p><p>Older Britons are more likely to take offence at being asked for a pre-nup, with 35% of the over-50s saying so compared to 29% of those aged 25-49 and 15% of 18-24 year olds. By contrast, there is little difference in attitudes between men and women.</p><h3>Do people think pre-nups make divorce more likely?</h3><p>While many would feel worse at receiving a pre-nup request, far fewer think that they actually make it more likely that a marriage or civil partnership breaks down. Just 15% think that knowledge of what would happen financially if a marriage ended increases the chance of divorce, with 51% believing it makes no difference.</p><p>Men are more likely than women to think that pre-nups are harbingers of marriage doom, by 19% to 10%.</p><p>Younger people are slightly more confident than older people in thinking that they actually reduce the chances of divorce, at 15% of 18-24 year olds compared to 4% of those aged 65 and above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhsZWl%2BcnnAq5xmqKKaeq%2FBz62gmqRdlrSzscSmnKeso2LCr77OppinrJmY</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
