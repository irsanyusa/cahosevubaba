Since then, the honor has been extended to the host of the show. Let’s reminisce on these iconic auditions by remembering each host Golden Buzzer recipient.</strong></p><p>While it seems like the Golden Buzzer has been around forever, it was actually introduced as a tiebreaker tool in 2014. At the time, it allowed an act to go on to the next round, judgement week, regardless of the judges vote. The format was updated in the following season, giving contestants more of a reward. Since season 10, the Golden Buzzer has sent its recipients into the live shows.</p><p>The Golden Buzzer format was once again updated in season 11 when host Nick Cannon hit the Golden Buzzer for the first time. Ever since, the Golden Buzzer has remained the same throughout the original series and spin-offs, AGT: The Champions and AGT: Extreme.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-dorothy-williams>1. Dorothy Williams</h2><p>Cannon gave the first ever host’s choice Golden Buzzer honor to a 90 year old exotic dancer, Dorothy Williams. She performed a saucy striptease that left the judges jaw dropped. Since it was uncertain whether they would send her through to the next round, the host hit the Golden Buzzer for Dorothy.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hylO7ROC-qw</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-light-balance>2. Light Balance</h2><p>Tyra Banks was the next AGT host to give the Golden Buzzer. In season 12, the supermodel chose to hit the Golden Buzzer for the dance crew, Light Balance. They showed off their insane choreography through the use of glow up costumes. After their audition, Banks hit the Golden Buzzer for them. They finished out the season in third place and later competed on America’s Got Talent: The Champions.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-zurcaroh>3. Zurcaroh</h2><p>Banks’s Golden Buzzer pick for season 13 was none other than acrobatic group <a href=#>Zurcaroh</a>. This group impressed the judges during their high energy acrobatic audition. Before the judges got the chance to vote, Banks hit the Golden Buzzer for Zurcaroh. They went on to place in second behind <a href=#>Shin Lim</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-kseniya-simonova>4.

He hit the buzzer for Kseniya Simonova, representative of Ukraine’s Got Talent. During her audition, she told a story through the use of sand art. The story was about a person that grew up to become a famous artists and forgot their parents over time. Kseniya finished as third place overall in her season.</p><p>This season of AGT: The Champions featured one more preliminary round than the following second season. Since the following spin-off season had one less episode, Crews was unable to use the Golden Buzzer.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-detroit-youth-choir>5. Detroit Youth Choir</h2><p>In season 14, Crews gave his Golden Buzzer out to Detroit Youth Choir.
