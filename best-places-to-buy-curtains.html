The right curtains can really change how a room looks, especially when you find the color and fabric that work best. They are also not just for aesthetics; curtains perform useful functions year-round, from shielding the room from summer sunlight to keeping the heat inside during the winter.</p><p>Balancing form and function can be tricky, which is why it’s important to buy your curtains from a reputable retailer that knows how to deliver what you need. Some companies are the go-to for simple, stylish silhouettes, while others offer a range of fun prints and textiles. Price ranges will also vary, which means there’s something for every budget. Here is a list of the best curtain retailers so that you can find the perfect solution for your space.</p><h2 id=our-picks-for-the-best-places-to-buy-curtains>Our picks for the best places to buy curtains</h2><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Anthropologie</a></h3><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.ctfassets.net/5de70he6op10/53ZOE4rRqrxcvv0hg2eSLV/a849085e5f600c618132be2475017746/anthro-logo.svg alt=Anthropologie title=Anthropologie width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>Anthropologie</h3><h6 class=description>Anthropologie is the best place to buy curtains for those who want to make an impact with vibrant, stylish designs that will stand out in a room.</h6></p><p>Example: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Sara Gordon Floral Curtain</a></p><p>Curtains from Anthropologie come in every color, fabric, and pattern, or at least it can seem that way when browsing their selection. The retailer focuses on original designs and interesting embroidery to compelling effect, although you can also find more classic neutrals and block colors. Depending on the particular product, the price range can vary quite substantially, which makes it worth checking out for those on a range of budgets. Once you’ve picked out your curtains, Anthropologie also offers several fun and quirky curtain ties to fully personalize the look. These curtains may be hanging in your windows, but they’re no wallflowers.</p><h4>Good to know:</h4><ul><li>Material selection: Linen, cotton, wool, polyester, velvet, rayon, acrylic, viscose, modal, lyocell, bamboo</li><li>Price Range: $58-$378</li><li>Return policy: 60-day returns</li><li>Delivery options: 2+ day shipping</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>A diverse range of styles and fabrics</li><li>Unique hardware options</li><li>Wide price range to accommodate different budgets.</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Options shown online are not always currently available to ship</li><li>No black-out or noise-reducing options; style over function</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Anthropologie is the best place to buy curtains for those who want to make an impact with vibrant, stylish designs that will stand out in a room.</p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Pottery Barn</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Pottery Barn</h3><h6 class=description>The classic curtain designs of Pottery Barn will suit nearly every home, especially thanks to the custom sizing and design consultations available.</h6></p><p>Example: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Belgian Flax Linen Curtains</a></p><p>Pottery Barn may be more known for their furniture options (they carry everything from stylish <a rel=alternate href=#>storage beds</a> to <a rel=alternate href=#>modular sofas</a>, <a rel=alternate href=#>patio umbrellas </a>to <a rel=alternate href=#>outdoor rugs</a>), but they offer an entire online vertical dedicated to window treatments.

Amazon’s size is its strength and also its weakness: There is truly something for everyone, but it may take time and patience to find exactly the right thing. The vast range of options is good news for anyone looking for something unique or specialized, such as extra-long lengths or fabrics that offer heat insulation. It’s also good news for those on a budget or short of time, with tons of affordable options under $10 and available with two-day shipping. As with other purchases from Amazon, there is some risk with unreliable merchants on the platform, but anyone willing to do their due diligence should be rewarded.</p><h4>Good to know:</h4><ul><li>Material selection: Linen, cotton, silk, polyester, nylon, rayon, vinyl, blackout, thermal, noise-reducing, outdoor performance fabric</li><li>Price range: $1-$1,535</li><li>Return policy: Varies merchant to merchant</li><li>Delivery options: Many are available with 1-2-day shipping (Prime), others may have different shipping options depending on the merchant</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>The largest range of designs, colors, and fabrics</li><li>Affordable options and fast delivery</li><li>High volume of customer reviews for added reliability</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>The volume of product can be overwhelming and time-consuming to sort through</li><li>Reliability and return policies depend on individual third-party merchants</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>If you’re willing to sort through hundreds of products or are looking for something very particular, Amazon is a safe option to find exactly what you need.</p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>The Shade Store</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>The Shade Store</h3><h6 class=description>The Shade Store offers the most comprehensive customer service and experience when it comes to drapery, but this quality comes at a higher price point.</h6></p><p>Example: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Pinch Pleat Drapery</a></p><p>If you’re looking for premium quality, it makes sense to consult the experts. When shopping for the best in curtains or drapes, that means visiting The Shade Store. At this brand, window treatments are the focus, and this expertise is reflected in the vast range of customization options available, as well as the professional level of service; shoppers can request a design consultation and receive a free measurement service. There is also the ability to add black-out or outdoor-performance qualities to the products and request free swatches of fabric. Of course, you pay for this level of quality and not everyone may want to invest so substantially in their curtains. It can also be a more labor-intensive process as these drapes can’t simply be bought ‘off the rack.’ For those with a clear vision and the ability to fund it, however, The Shade Store is the ultimate purveyor of customized, classic curtains. (Shopping tip: The Shade Store also made our list for the best blinds for windows.)</p><h4>Good to know:</h4><ul><li>Material selection: Cotton, linen, wool, silk, metallic, outdoor performance fabric,<br>blackout lining</li><li>Price Range: $265–$1,255+</li><li>Return policy: No returns (as all are custom)</li><li>Delivery options: Free shipping</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Ultimate customization available</li><li>Free swatches to ensure the right fabric choice</li><li>Expert customer service, from measurement services to design consultations</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>High starting price point</li><li>No returns</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>The Shade Store offers the most comprehensive customer service and experience when it comes to drapery, but this quality comes at a higher price point.</p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>West Elm</a></h3><p>Example: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Worn Velvet Blackout Curtain</a></p><p><h3 class=title>West Elm</h3><h6 class=description>West Elm curtains embody classic luxury and are a great choice for fuss-free elegance, if you’re willing to spend a little more.</h6></p><p>West Elm is known for its understated elegance and its curtains fit this mold as well. The 44 available styles are all in classic neutrals or muted deep shades of blue and green, with some subtle prints interspersed throughout the collection. Unlike most other ready-made products, these curtains come in sizes up to 108 inches long, which makes them perfect for high ceilings or adding drama to a space. Prices are higher than at many other retailers on this list, especially if you opt for the largest size, but this comes in exchange for premium quality materials and consistently stylish designs. You won’t find bright colors or quirky prints here, so maximalists might want to shop elsewhere, but West Elm does offer a wide range of accompanying hardware and even outdoor performance curtains.</p><h4>Good to know:</h4><ul><li>Material selection: Linen, cotton, polyester, velvet, outdoor performance</li><li>Price range: $30-$890</li><li>Return policy: 30-day returns</li><li>Delivery options: Standard and next day shipping available</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Extra-long lengths readily available</li><li>Elegant designs in understated colors</li><li>Outdoor performance options</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Minimal prints, no bright colors</li><li>Higher price points</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>West Elm curtains embody classic luxury and are a great choice for fuss-free elegance, if you’re willing to spend a little more.</p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Society6</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Society6</h3><h6 class=description>Society6 is a great option for curtains with vibrant designs and interesting prints, created by independent artists, that are also available in sheer finishes.</h6></p><p>Example: <a rel=nofollow href=#>William Morris ‘Kelmscott Tree' Blackout Curtain</a></p><p>Turn to Society6 for all your print and pattern needs. The retailer offers its curtains in either blackout or sheer styles so that you can choose the amount of light you want to let in without compromising on fun designs. Most places offer only plain sheer drapes, but not at Society6. These aren’t the cheapest curtains, but each one is designed by independent creators, so you can feel confident that you are supporting small businesses. Fabric quality is not quite as luxe as some other high-end retailers, so these curtains are best suited for people who are more focused on an original design or bold print.</p><h4>Good to know:</h4><ul><li>Material selection: Polyester, blackout, light-filtering</li><li>Price range: $59-$165</li><li>Return policy: 60-day returns</li><li>Delivery options: 5-10 business days for standard shipping</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>A wide range of colorful, interesting designs</li><li>Purchases support independent creators</li><li>Prints are available in sheer and blackout finishes</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Limited range of fabrics</li><li>Expensive for the fabric quality</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Society6 is a great option for curtains with vibrant designs and interesting prints, created by independent artists, that are also available in sheer finishes.</p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Wayfair</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Wayfair</h3><h6 class=description>For a more lifestyle-centric version of Amazon, shop for your curtains at Wayfair and take advantage of its great range and affordable pricing.</h6></p><p>Example: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Nicole Miller Wellington Embellished Slub Sheer Pair</a></p><p>Wayfair could be considered the Amazon of home goods, thanks to the vast selection of brands and items included in its catalog. In fact, it currently has 45,000 different kinds of curtains in stock, ranging in price from affordable to luxe and in style from classic to quirky. Navigating this collection can be time-consuming, but helpful filters can narrow it down to a more manageable assortment. Anyone is practically guaranteed to find whatever it is they need within this selection, but Wayfair’s products will particularly appeal to anyone prioritizing affordability; there is a substantial number of options under $50 and even $25. One thing to note is that shipping speed and product quality will vary from brand to brand, so double-check your order before checkout.</p><h4>Good to know:</h4><ul><li>Material selection: Linen, cotton blend, cotton, polyester, velvet, silk, synthetic, rayon,<br>sateen, lace, bamboo, microfiber, black-out</li><li>Price Range: $6-$1288</li><li>Return policy: 30-day returns</li><li>Delivery options: Some items eligible for 1-day delivery</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>The huge assortment of options</li><li>Great price points for every budget</li><li>Some products eligible for 1-day delivery</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Can be overwhelming to navigate</li><li>Products often out of stock</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>For a more lifestyle-centric version of Amazon, shop for your curtains at Wayfair and take advantage of its great range and affordable pricing.</p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Annie Selke</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Annie Selke</h3><h6 class=description>For original prints and classic neutrals that are machine-washable across the board, shop the curtain selection at Annie Selke.</h6></p><p>Example: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Anatolia Linen Curtain Panel</a></p><p>The curtain collection at Annie Selke is limited in comparison to bigger retailers, but they pack a punch. This smaller retailer has curated a range of interesting yet accessible designs, such as oversized polka dots and monochromatic botanicals, for customers who want something thoughtfully different. You can also find classic styles here, and there are several neutral colors, of course, but the more vibrant curtains are where Annie Selke really shines. That and the fact that all the materials are machine-washable, whether they’re made of linen, polyester, or cotton. Easy cleaning makes the slightly higher price point a worthy investment, as these products should last a while. Annie Selke also offers several different sizing options than you’ll find at big box retailers.</p><h4>Good to know:</h4><ul><li>Material selection: Linen, polyester, cotton</li><li>Price range: $49-$378</li><li>Return policy: Free 30-day returns</li><li>Delivery options: $15 for standard shipping (unless spend is $350+)</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Interesting, visually-appealing designs</li><li>All styles are machine washable</li><li>There are a range of sizes available</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Shipping costs $15 unless orders are over $350</li><li>The selection is quite small</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>For original prints and classic neutrals that are machine-washable across the board, shop the curtain selection at Annie Selke.</p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Parachute</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Parachute</h3><h6 class=description>For high-quality linen and classic shades of white or gray, you can’t go wrong with Parachute’s curtains that come in black-out or regular versions.</h6></p><p>Example: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Washed Linen Curtain</a></p><p>Beloved for their bedding (especially for having some of the best bed sheets), Parachute has now branched out into the home market with its limited selection of curtains and hardware. This compact collection was launched in 2020 and currently offers just two styles—blackout or regular in two colors, white or natural gray. This makes the brand an ideal choice for minimalists or those who are easily overwhelmed by choices available. With Parachute, you can be confident that you will be getting high-quality fabrics delivered sustainably and with impeccable customer service. There are only two size options, so this might not be the best retailer for people who need custom drapes.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Material selection: Linen</li><li>Price range: $169-$219</li><li>Return policy: Free 60-day returns</li><li>Delivery options: Free carbon-neutral shipping</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Clean lines and silhouettes</li><li>High-quality linen</li><li>Optional black-out version</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Limited colorways</li><li>Starting price is comparatively high</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>For high-quality linen and classic shades of white or gray, you can’t go wrong with Parachute’s curtains that come in black-out or regular versions.</p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Home Depot</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Home Depot</h3><h6 class=description>Home Depot delivers curtains for every possible need and aesthetic, with a huge range of options at affordable prices.</h6></p><p>Example: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Vue Voile White Solid Polyester Sheer Single Panel</a></p><p>This major home improvement retailer has a surprisingly good range of curtain choices—you’ll find blackout, light-filtering, sheer, outdoor performance, noise-canceling, etc. With over 2,000 options to choose from, the affordable collection also offers a range of aesthetics to suit every home. From fun florals to geometric shapes, these designs aren’t necessarily the most avant-garde or original but instead are familiar favorites.

Colors are all very on-trend, favoring warm pinks and sage greens, and the options are all clearly designed to suit a millennial’s home. While there are minimal options under $50, the high end of the range is still much lower in price than other retailers on our list, making this an accessible option for shoppers who value being up to date with fashion trends and don’t want to compromise on dull curtains. They only offer one size, however, so be sure to measure your curtains first.</p><h4>Good to know:</h4><ul><li>Material selection: Cotton, polyester, beaded, macrame, velvet</li><li>Price Range: $34-$173</li><li>Return policy: 30-day return policy, $5 restocking fee</li><li>Delivery options: Standard shipping available, rush shipping available for $25</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Contemporary colors and designs</li><li>Mid-range price point with nothing over $175</li><li>Option for 1-2 day shipping</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Mostly sheer or limited light-filtering options</li><li>Fewer fabric choices</li><li>Only one size available for majority of curtains</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Trend-conscious shoppers will love the aesthetic of Urban Outfitters curtains, which come in many different and appealing sheer colors and prints.</p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Pepper Home</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Pepper Home</h3><h6 class=description>At Pepper Home you can transform their beautiful, high-end fabrics into truly customized curtains, for a pricey yet one-of-a-kind result.</h6></p><p>Example: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Julia Custom Curtain</a></p><p>Pepper Home puts a premium on beautiful fabrics made in the USA and so their curtains all come in high-quality cotton or velvet.

I took into account customer reviews, expert opinions, and my own personal experiences with these brands. Then I made sure to consider the different needs that curtain shoppers may have so that we could be confident there is something on this list for everyone.</p><h2 id=what-to-keep-in-mind-when-buying-curtains>What to keep in mind when buying curtains</h2><h3>How long should my curtains be?</h3><p>It’s important to measure your windows and ceiling height before purchasing any curtains to ensure you get the right size you’re looking for. You should also consider where you will be hanging your curtains; if you’re using a tension rod within the window frame, then you need a shorter length than if you’re installing a curtain rod above the top of the frame. Most designers recommend hanging the curtains about 4-6 inches above the top of the window to create a framing effect. Another general rule is to have the hem of the curtains fall just above the floor, with a gap of about ¼ inch. This ensures that the fabric doesn’t drag along the ground or collect dust while still creating a sense of height.</p><h3>What fabric or style should I buy?</h3><p>Depending on where you’ll be putting the curtains, you might want different performance aspects. Consider how much light or sound a room gets and whether you want to enhance or minimize that so that you can figure out what curtains will serve you best. Many people like blackout curtains in the bedroom to ensure a good night’s sleep, particularly if the windows are east-facing, while others may want to protect light if it’s limited and focus more on the aesthetic of a sheer curtain. Outdoor spaces will require different fabrics that can withstand the elements, while households with pets or young children may favor machine-washable materials.</p><p>Once these needs have been considered, it’s time to think about the look. Everyone’s taste is different, so think about how the curtains will work with the rest of the room. Velvet can add drama and elegance, while others will focus more on the color or print design. There’s no right or wrong, just whatever looks best to you.</p><h3>Do I need custom drapery?</h3><p>Most retailers sell curtains in a couple of standard sizes because these work for the majority of windows, so you are probably okay to purchase ready-made products. However, do measure your curtains first to make sure. If you have particularly high ceilings or an especially large or oddly shaped window, you may need to have something made specially to fit. In these cases, custom curtains are the best solution to ensure a seamless look.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What is the difference between curtains and drapes?</h3><p>While both curtains and drapes are pieces of fabric that cover a window, there are a couple of small differences. Drapes are usually made of heavier fabrics than curtains and sometimes feature a lining, which offers greater light-filtering functionality. Curtains are commonly cut to fit the size of the window or a few inches below, particularly in spaces like kitchens or bathrooms, while drapes hang to the ground and may even puddle on the floor. As such, drapes can be thought of as a more formal version of curtains, meant to add gravitas and anchor the room.</p><h3>How much should I expect to pay for curtains?</h3><p>As shown in our list of top retailers, the price range for curtains can vary significantly. If you are looking to spend on the lower side, you can spend as little as $20-50 on a pair of curtains that should do the job you need. Non-custom curtains can go up to a few hundred dollars, however, if you’re investing in premium fabrics, specialty designs, or longer lengths. For custom curtains, expect to spend at least a hundred dollars and potentially much more.</p><h3>Are expensive curtains worth it?</h3><p>This will really depend on your needs. If your focus is mostly on the look of a room, you can likely get a great option at a lower price point that will get the job done. This is particularly true if you want simple colors and designs. However, if you are particular about the quality of fabric for your curtains or are looking for something a little more sophisticated, it may be worth it to you to spend a bit more as these curtains should last you years. Finally, if you have an odd-shaped window or need something unique, it will look better if you pay for a custom product rather than try to cobble together different ready-made curtains. Spending a bit more for a tailored fit will result in a much cleaner look.</p><h3>How do you make a room look expensive with curtains?</h3><p>Taste is subjective, so there is no one color or fabric that will instantly make a room look more expensive. High-quality fabrics and softer colors can often look more expensive, but don’t feel like you have to give up your prints. Instead, focus on how the curtain fits the window and how it blends with the rest of the room. Curtains should never be too small. Instead, they should fall nearly to the ground and ideally should be hung a few inches above the window frame to create the illusion of higher ceilings. Pair curtains with quality hardware and consider adding a curtain tie or hardware tieback to upgrade the look. If in doubt, choose a more neutral color to complement the rest of the room, but a statement design can also take the look to the next level and tie the whole room together if you’re willing to go for it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1loKGupLHSZquoZZKqxm6v1KurmqGeqHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
