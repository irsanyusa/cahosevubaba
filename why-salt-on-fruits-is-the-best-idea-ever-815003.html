You pick up&nbsp;the phone to&nbsp;call and complain, but right then the chef explains. It&nbsp;turns out that adding salt to&nbsp;fruit is&nbsp;a&nbsp;common thing in&nbsp;different cuisines across the world. In&nbsp;Mexico, they like to&nbsp;spice up&nbsp;mango and citrus fruits with salt and chili powder. You can try mango with a&nbsp;shrimp taste in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=Philippines data-link=tag>Philippines</a> and salted watermelon in&nbsp;the Southern states.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/31d/a1d/2bdb7b53efb425a59f4448904a.png><p>So, how does it&nbsp;work? Let’s say you’re eating a&nbsp;raw mango sprinkled with salt. With the first bite, you notice the salty flavor, and the sweet fruity taste is&nbsp;then slightly delayed. It&nbsp;feels as&nbsp;juicy and amazing as&nbsp;ever. It’s most likely because salt affects the sweet taste receptor for sugar, and then really magic happens on&nbsp;a&nbsp;molecular level. One study even found that we&nbsp;have more sugar detectors in&nbsp;our taste cells than scientists previously thought. One of&nbsp;those detectors must direct sugar to&nbsp;a&nbsp;sweet-taste cell when it&nbsp;gets in&nbsp;contact with salt.</p><p>You can try and put salt on&nbsp;any fruit you like, but the effect will be&nbsp;different. Salt can make sweeter fruits like cherries and strawberries even sweeter and balance the flavor of&nbsp;grapefruit, pineapple, and watermelon. Just take a&nbsp;ripe fruit and slice it&nbsp;the regular way and sprinkle the pieces with salt. Large flaked sea salt might taste more intense, plus it&nbsp;looks more beautiful. After 10&nbsp;minutes, your gourmet dessert will be&nbsp;ready.</p><p>So, you need to&nbsp;chop up&nbsp;a&nbsp;heap of&nbsp;iceberg lettuce, but that tough core in&nbsp;the middle doesn’t want to&nbsp;leave. Just hold the lettuce head in&nbsp;both hands with the core end down and slam it&nbsp;against a&nbsp;cutting board or&nbsp;some other solid surface. Not your brother. Now you should be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;pull the core right out of&nbsp;the bottom and slice the rest of&nbsp;the lettuce without a&nbsp;problem.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/320/15a/e68c1a5e728f37c4da3e1a3ad6.png><p>The next time you take the <a href=# title=butter data-link=tag>butter</a> out of&nbsp;the fridge and struggle to&nbsp;spread it&nbsp;because, you know, it’s hard as&nbsp;a&nbsp;rock, reach for your grater. With its help, you’ll easily flake off tiny pieces of&nbsp;butter that will melt instantly on&nbsp;a&nbsp;warm toast. You can also spread them much easier on&nbsp;cold bread without putting your sandwich in&nbsp;the microwave or&nbsp;waiting for a&nbsp;while to&nbsp;soften the butter. Professional bakers approve of&nbsp;this tip and have been using it&nbsp;for a&nbsp;long time.</p><p>When you’re frying something, you first heat the pan and then put the food on&nbsp;it, right? Well, this logic won’t work if&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;make your bacon crispy. On&nbsp;a&nbsp;hot pan, the meat will cook before the fat can melt out of&nbsp;it. Your bacon will be&nbsp;too fatty and rubbery. So, you gotta lay the strips on&nbsp;a&nbsp;cold pan and then turn on&nbsp;medium-low heat. The fat will render out of&nbsp;the meat, and the final result will be&nbsp;super yummy and crispy.</p><p>Have you ever tried boiling <a href=# title=pasta data-link=tag>pasta</a> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;frying pan? I&nbsp;know it&nbsp;sounds a&nbsp;bit weird, but it&nbsp;can actually help you save a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time, water, and energy. Instead of&nbsp;filling a&nbsp;huge pot with water and waiting for it&nbsp;to&nbsp;boil, put your pasta in&nbsp;a&nbsp;frying pan and cover it&nbsp;with cold water and add some salt to&nbsp;it. Your pasta will be&nbsp;cooking while the water is&nbsp;getting to&nbsp;the boiling point, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;ready much faster than normal. And that water left in&nbsp;the pan will make an&nbsp;excellent base for a&nbsp;sauce because it’s filled with starch. Mix it&nbsp;with pesto, tomato sauce, and garlic butter&nbsp;— mmmmm, it&nbsp;tastes like it’s straight out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;gourmet restaurant.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/591/00e/54c0b85f1aad5a7c6d84626afc.png><p>The secret to&nbsp;cooking the most delicious and fluffy mashed potatoes is&nbsp;to&nbsp;dry them before you mash them. After boiling, you can either put them in&nbsp;a&nbsp;pot and leave them over low heat on&nbsp;the stovetop or&nbsp;keep them on&nbsp;a&nbsp;baking sheet in&nbsp;a&nbsp;low oven. Then, add melted butter that will coat the starch in&nbsp;the potatoes, and only then slowly add milk. Now your mashed potatoes will have the best possible structure and flavor.</p><p>If&nbsp;you’ve shed enough tears over onions when trying to&nbsp;slice them, this one is&nbsp;a&nbsp;must-try for you. Peel the onions, cut them in&nbsp;half, and leave them in&nbsp;a&nbsp;fridge in&nbsp;a&nbsp;bowl of&nbsp;iced water for half an&nbsp;hour before you start cooking. The reason behind your tears is&nbsp;the sulfur that onions take from the soil while growing&nbsp;up. When you damage its cells, the acids contact the enzymes that start a&nbsp;whole bunch of&nbsp;reactions and release a&nbsp;chemical that makes your eyes water. Freezing the onion can weaken that chemical. To&nbsp;minimize it&nbsp;even more, only use a&nbsp;sharp knife to&nbsp;slice onions. This way, you’ll do&nbsp;less damage to&nbsp;its cells.</p><p>It’s much easier to&nbsp;peel an&nbsp;<a href=# title=avocado data-link=tag>avocado</a> if&nbsp;you freeze it&nbsp;first. Just put it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the fridge as&nbsp;it&nbsp;is, give it&nbsp;some time, then take it&nbsp;out and hold it&nbsp;under warm running water. Now you can peel it&nbsp;easily after you make a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;criss-cross incisions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/c15/be8/5f1e3b5a1283de3a8662f0484a.png><p>The best way to&nbsp;keep herbs fresh and juicy is&nbsp;to&nbsp;store them like <a href=# title=flowers data-link=tag>flowers</a>. If&nbsp;you don’t have the right size vase, take a&nbsp;Mason jar or&nbsp;a&nbsp;water glass and fill it&nbsp;with an&nbsp;inch of&nbsp;water. Now put the herbs inside as&nbsp;you would do&nbsp;to&nbsp;your roses. For parsley and cilantro, cover the jar with a&nbsp;plastic bag and store the bouquet in&nbsp;the fridge. Basil loves sunlight, so&nbsp;you’d better leave it&nbsp;uncovered on&nbsp;the counter.</p><p>If&nbsp;you’ve made too much sauce or&nbsp;have some leftovers in&nbsp;a&nbsp;can that doesn’t seem to&nbsp;be&nbsp;enough for anything, you can save it&nbsp;from the trash can. Pour the sauce into an&nbsp;ice cube tray and keep it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the freezer. Now if&nbsp;you need to&nbsp;spice up&nbsp;a&nbsp;meal, you can always add a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;sauce cubes to&nbsp;it. Plus, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;bonus (which is&nbsp;redundant), the sauce will last longer this way than it&nbsp;would in&nbsp;the fridge.</p><p>Do&nbsp;your meatballs always turn out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;perfectly the same shape and size? Then just skip this one. But if&nbsp;you’re more like&nbsp;me, just use an&nbsp;ice cream scoop to&nbsp;get the right amount of&nbsp;your minced meat mix. Try saying that five times. The balls will be&nbsp;the ideal shape, and your fingers won’t get sticky.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/2a4/cff/c1bdf25586a7ff1912e331c32c.png><p>The easiest and probably the most beautiful way to&nbsp;slice a&nbsp;mango is&nbsp;to&nbsp;turn it&nbsp;into a&nbsp;“Hedgehog.” Wash the mango under running water. Don’t squeeze it&nbsp;while doing&nbsp;it. Now, put it&nbsp;straight up&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;cutting board and cut it&nbsp;into 3&nbsp;pieces from the top downwards. Just leave that flat pit in&nbsp;the middle piece, there isn’t much you can do&nbsp;with it&nbsp;anyway. Now your mango will have two cute cheeks.</p><p>I&nbsp;mean, its fattest parts. Next, make crosswise and lengthwise cuts in&nbsp;the mango cheeks. Leave some even distance between the incisions, and don’t go&nbsp;all the way through the skin. Now press on&nbsp;the back side of&nbsp;the mango until the flesh pokes out. Does it&nbsp;look like something to&nbsp;you? Yep, a&nbsp;hedgehog, hence the name of&nbsp;this slicing method. The final step will be&nbsp;to&nbsp;slice off the mango cubes into a&nbsp;bowl. Then eat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/54e/639/95b8cb5d16a0e58fa73cffc0d2.png><p>This one has all the potential to&nbsp;become your new breakfast favorite: you can cook an&nbsp;omelet in&nbsp;a&nbsp;mug! Take a&nbsp;large microwave-safe mug and coat the inside of&nbsp;it&nbsp;with olive oil or&nbsp;spray it&nbsp;with cooking spray. Add two eggs and 1&nbsp;tablespoon of&nbsp;milk and mix them with a&nbsp;fork. Now add salt and pepper and any cheese, veggies, and herbs you like. Put it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the microwave on&nbsp;high for 30&nbsp;seconds. Take it&nbsp;out, stir it&nbsp;with a&nbsp;fork, and then put it&nbsp;back in&nbsp;for another 30&nbsp;seconds. And voila, your breakfast is&nbsp;served! Be&nbsp;sure to&nbsp;use another mug for your coffee, otherwise you get eggs in&nbsp;your coffee, and nobody has a&nbsp;recipe for that.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYysmKWsXaS7brLRrqCtq12ewG7Ax55km52jqXqqsMSaZJ6ulad6eX2UaWdsZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
