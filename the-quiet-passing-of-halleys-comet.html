It was last here in 1986, and scientists expect it to return in 2061.</p><p>It is named after English <a href=#>astronomer</a> <a href=#>Edmond Halley</a>, who was born in London and lived from 1656 until 1742. He studied reports of comets that had been approaching Earth in 1531, 1607 and 1682.</p><p>His studies led him to conclude that the three bodies were in fact the same comet orbiting the sun and he worked out that it would return close to Earth in 1758. Halley’s prediction turned out to be correct, but he did not live to see it. Nevertheless, in time the comet came to be named officially in his honour as 1P/Halley.</p><p>It is known as a “periodic” comet and was noted in 1066 when, over in France, William, Duke of Normandy, was preparing the conquest of England. He took control of the country by defeating King Harold at the Battle of Hastings and thereafter became known as <a href=#>William the Conqueror</a>.</p><p>Shortly before the invasion Halley’s Comet was seen in the sky and William believed its appearance heralded his success.</p><p>The event is recorded on the Bayeux Tapestry, the famous 70-metre (230 feet)-long record of the conquest which has been classified as a Historic Monument since 1840. It was entrusted to the French city of Bayeux in 1804 by Napoléon Bonaparte and attracts more than 400,000 visitors a year.</p><p>In her 2005 book&nbsp;La Tapisserie de Bayeux, Sylvette Lemagnen, conservator of the tapestry, wrote: “The Bayeux Tapestry's survival almost intact over nine centuries is little short of miraculous&nbsp;... Its exceptional length, the harmony and freshness of its colours, its exquisite workmanship, and the genius of its guiding spirit combine to make it endlessly fascinating.”</p><p>For Halley himself the endless fascination lay more in matters concerning his comet and in 1691 he applied for the post of Savilian Professor of Astronomy at Oxford University. He was undoubtedly well qualified for the job but found himself up against a religious wall.</p><p><a href=#>John Flamsteed</a>, the God-fearing Astronomer Royal of the day, joined members of the Anglican Church to criticise Halley’s faith because he had publicly doubted the age of the Earth as given in the Bible. He had also contended that Noah's flood could have been the result of a cometary impact.</p><p>It was enough to wreck Halley’s academic hopes. Ironically, he succeeded Flamsteed as Astronomer Royal in 1720, and continued to hold the position until his <a href=#>death in 1742</a> at the age of 85.</p><p>*The name Halley rhymes with the word ‘valley’ and seemed to be straight forward until the late 1950s when a rock star took the pop world by storm with his recording of Rock Around The Clock. His name was <a href=#>Bill Haley</a> and with a nod to the astronomer named his backing band The Comets.</p><p>As Bill Haley and The Comets rocketed to fame their influence was believed by many to have been instrumental in the frequent – and incorrect – reference to the celestial body as Haley’s comet.</p><p><b>Published:</b> <i>April 4, 2022</i><br><b>Updated:</b> <i>May 17, 2024</i></p><br><h2>Related Articles and Photos</h2><h2>Related Famous People</h2><a href=# class=section__link><h2>Articles on Events in May</h2></a><ul class=article-list><li class=article-list__item><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.onthisday.com/images/articles/janet-gaynor-sml.jpg alt="Silence is Golden At The First Oscars" width=270 height=225 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Silence is Golden At The First Oscars</h3><span class=linked_text>The first Academy Awards ceremony took place on this day before just 250 guests.
