I have spent the last three decades spearheading several national initiatives, including a permanent memorial in Washington, D.C., and a national day of honor, paying tribute to these courageous men and woman who have sacrificed limbs and organs, who have been horribly burned or made blind and deaf, and who have suffered from the ravages of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</a> and traumatic brain injury.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Knowing of these potential consequences, these American heroes took an oath to defend our democracy at all costs. They swore they would die for us and for the ideals that we enjoy and cherish.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Their sacrifices are being tarnished by those who seek to undermine and even obliterate its founding principles. The hatred, vitriol and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anti-Semitic</a> and racist views being spewed by the neo-Nazis and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">white supremacists</a> who marched in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlottesville</a> have planned and executed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rallies in other cities</a>. They <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">use the Internet</a> and other means of communication to disseminate their abhorrent beliefs. They are repugnant and repulsive and antithetical to everything that this country stands for.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Anyone, including the President, who would demonstrate even a modicum of support for them by insisting that there are “very fine people” among them is not deserving of patronage in any form, from any person or foundation. When you march wearing the very same <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">swastikas</a> and shouting the very same mantras championed by Hitler, you are not a “fine” person by any definition.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Therefore, I recommended to my board that we move this year’s 24th Annual Lady in Red Gala on December 2 — which raises substantial funds for those very millions of men and women of all persuasions who have fought in defense of America’s ideals — from the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mar-a-Lago Club</a>, which is owned by the President. The board agreed.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I did this knowing that this decision would not be met by unanimous approval, even among some of my closest friends. I live just a short drive from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mar-a-Lago</a>. I have been a member of the club for a quarter-century and have enjoyed hundreds of luncheons, dinners and other events there. In fact, when the President purchased the property and turned it into a private resort, he personally asked me to serve as its membership chairwoman. Moreover, my foundations have held numerous fundraising events, including more than 20 Lady in Red galas, at the estate.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I am a child of the Depression and came of age during World War II. Although we had little, my parents taught me that helping and caring for others less fortunate is an obligation; I vividly recall my mother saving a nickel here and there to give to the neediest. They taught me that silence in the face of injustice is itself an injustice. These lessons serve as the catalyst for my inclusion of the word “Life” in the names of all my philanthropic endeavors; I hope to give “life” to those who are deprived, disregarded, underserved and under-represented, who are voiceless and vulnerable, marginalized and forgotten.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I cannot stand idly by. I cannot be silent. I cannot let the intolerant be tolerated. I want my family — and all American families — to know that speaking up and rising up to hatred and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">discrimination</a> in all forms is both a personal responsibility and the right thing to do.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtcWNpgXaBjqWmoqtdpbyxsYymmKtlkWK5orPOZp6apJFiwbPBzKlknKCRp7mwwNOeqq%2BhnKGycA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
