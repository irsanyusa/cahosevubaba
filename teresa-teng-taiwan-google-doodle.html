Today, on what would have been <a href=# rel=noopener>the singer’s</a> 65th birthday, Teng is celebrated with a Google Doodle.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Teng was born on Jan. 29, 1953 in Taiwan, and became a breakout star in Japan in the 1970s. Known as one of the “Five Great Asian Divas,” Teng was celebrated across Asia for her melancholy love songs, including “I Only Care About You,” “When Will You Return?” and “The Moon Represents My Heart,” portrayed in Monday’s Doodle. Taiwanese songwriter Tsuo Hung-yun <a href=# rel=noopener>called her voice</a> ”seven parts sweetness, three parts tears.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Despite geopolitical tensions, Teng was a sensation across the straits, where she offered “an alternative to the mostly revolutionary songs then prevalent in mainland China,” according to Google. Known in Chinese as Deng Lijun, Teng shared a family name with Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, leading fans to nickname her “Little Deng” and <a href=# rel=noopener>giving rise </a>to the aphorism, “Deng the leader ruled by day, but Deng the singer ruled by night.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/gettyimages-184629130.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But Teng never performed in mainland China, and her music was banned there in the early 1980s. She was a supporter of democracy and following the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing, she performed concerts for the student protesters, the New Yorker <a href=# rel=noopener>reports</a>. Her music proved “a litmus test of the political winds” in China, according to an <a href=# rel=noopener>obituary </a>in the New York Times.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Teng herself never married, though she was linked to a few high-profile romantic partners, <a href=#>including </a>film star Jackie Chan, and she died unexpectedly following an asthma attack while on holiday in Chiang Mai, Thailand in 1995, at the age of 42. But neither Teng’s music nor her cultural impact have been forgotten, and in 2013 she was reborn for an audience of 15,000 in Taipei, where a <a href=# rel=noopener>hologram accompanied</a> some of the singer’s greatest hits.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZuaWJngXOEjq2cq52jlnq1sc2gZK2Zmayur3nGqKagpJVisbC7w6WcaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
