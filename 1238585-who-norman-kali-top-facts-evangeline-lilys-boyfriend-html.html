Kali is one of the most private celebrities who tend to enjoy living a secluded life away from the public eye. Although most of his fans may reveal some disappointment due to lack of specific details regarding him, it is, however, crystal clear that Norman has no intentions of disclosing the information.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7ba4604391ae51ff.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Roxy Horner biography: who is Jack Whitehallâ€™s girlfriend?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, since celebrities such as J.Cole who have always regarded themselves as private have begun opening up about their lives and early life in their music, admirers of Kali can only pray that the production assistant will one day open up about his life perhaps through a movie he produces. The one obvious thing is that Norman is a talented production assistant. He is famous for his work in Tears of the Sun (2003) and Tropic Thunder (2008).</p><p class=align-left>Despite being a production assistant, Kali is also an actor and has starred in The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (2013). The irony is that Kali's long-term girlfriend Evangeline Lily is not a private person. She is very forthcoming about details fans want to know, such as when and where she was born, when she ventured into acting, when her birthday is, and also her educational background. Norman has however revealed that he has an ethnic descent, was born and raised in Hawaii.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f88c94b2264a3503.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Tyler Nixon bio: age, height, real name, girlfriend, is he gay?</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>CNN Brianna Keilar bio: age, pregnancy, husband, divorce, net worth</p><h2>Who is Evangeline Lily?</h2><p class=align-left>Evangeline Lily is a Canadian actress who was born in Fort Saskatchewan in Alberta <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">on August 3, 1979</a>. Her birth name was Nicole Evangeline Lily. Despite being born in Alberta, Nicole was raised in British Columbia by her mother, who was a produce manager and her father, who was a home economics teacher. Nicole is the middle sibling and has a younger and elder sister. The acting was not a passion for this beauty, In fact, most people are impressed due to her outstanding acting skills, yet she never saw acting as a career.</p><p class=align-left>Nicole began her acting career after being approached by a Ford Modeling Agency. The agent approached her as she was walking down the streets of Kelowna, British Columbia and gave her a business card. She did not call the agent immediately. After some time had passed, Lily took her phone and called the agent who landed her specific roles in commercials and non-speaking parts in television shows such as Smallville and Kingdom Hospital.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a125024636a2337d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Dalton Gomez, Ariana Grande's new sweetheart?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Later on, there were auditions for the television series Lost.

Abrams to review the cast, Damon came across the auditioning tape of Lily and knew immediately that she was the one. Lily managed to get the part of Kate Austen.</p><p class=align-left>Despite her success in landing the role, it was problematic to acquire a work visa to allow her to enter the United States.
