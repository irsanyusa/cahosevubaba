Her life took a challenging turn six months ago when she and her husband, Matt, welcomed twin boys into their world. While the arrival of their children brought immense joy, it also brought unforeseen challenges that began to strain their marriage.</p><p>Emma shared her full story with us.</p><p><h2>This is&nbsp;Emma’s story.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f72/c53/cb67a551189ada186751328eae.jpg><p>Emma started her letter with a&nbsp;heavy heart: “Hi, <strong>Bright Side</strong>. I&nbsp;never thought I’d be&nbsp;sharing something like this, but I’m feeling lost and alone, and&nbsp;I don’t know what to&nbsp;do. My&nbsp;husband, Matt, and&nbsp;I have been together for eight years, and married for five. We’ve always had a&nbsp;strong relationship, full of&nbsp;love and understanding. But since the birth of&nbsp;our twins, things have changed so&nbsp;drastically that&nbsp;I barely recognize&nbsp;us anymore.”</p><p>“Matt and&nbsp;I had always dreamed of&nbsp;having children, and when we&nbsp;found out we&nbsp;were expecting twins, we&nbsp;were overjoyed. But no&nbsp;one really prepares you for the reality of&nbsp;raising two babies at&nbsp;once. The sleepless nights, the constant feedings, the endless diapers—it’s overwhelming, to&nbsp;say the least. And as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;I love our boys, I&nbsp;feel like I’m drowning under the weight of&nbsp;it&nbsp;all.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1ce/36f/e3f6e55f14a5be3a7c52a8410a.jpg><p>She continued, “Since the twins were born, my&nbsp;entire world has revolved around them. I’m exhausted all the time, barely getting a&nbsp;few hours of&nbsp;sleep each night. Matt has been helping, but he&nbsp;also has to&nbsp;work long hours to&nbsp;support&nbsp;us, so&nbsp;most of&nbsp;the childcare falls on&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;know I’ve been distant, and&nbsp;I feel guilty about&nbsp;it, but&nbsp;I just don’t have the energy for anything else. I&nbsp;haven’t had a&nbsp;moment to&nbsp;myself in&nbsp;months, and our relationship has suffered because of&nbsp;it.”</p><p>“Matt came to&nbsp;me&nbsp;last night and said he’s thinking about leaving. He&nbsp;told me&nbsp;he&nbsp;feels neglected, like&nbsp;I don’t care about him anymore. He&nbsp;said he&nbsp;misses the way things used to&nbsp;be, just the two of&nbsp;us, and that he&nbsp;doesn’t feel like a&nbsp;priority in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life now. Hearing those words broke my&nbsp;heart, because the truth&nbsp;is, I&nbsp;miss&nbsp;us too. But I&nbsp;don’t know how to&nbsp;balance being a&nbsp;good mother and a&nbsp;good wife when&nbsp;I feel like I’m barely holding&nbsp;on.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/86a/220/aa8c5759319086d6b4e5859242.jpg><p>Emma then shared, "I tried to explain to Matt that this is just a phase, that the boys won’t be this demanding forever, and that we’ll find our way back to each other. But he just looked so defeated, like he’s already made up his mind. I don’t want to lose him, but I also don’t know how to fix this. How do I show him that I still love him when I’m too exhausted to even think straight?"</p><p>"Now, I’m sitting here, staring at my sleeping babies, wondering how I can possibly choose between my husband and my children. I don’t want to lose my marriage, but I don’t want to fail as a mother either. What should I do?"</p><p><h2>We appreciate your bravery in sharing your story with us, so we've put together a few tips to help.</h2></p><p>Navigating the challenges of&nbsp;motherhood while maintaining a&nbsp;strong relationship can feel overwhelming, especially with the added pressures of&nbsp;raising twins.

This can help him feel more connected to&nbsp;both you and the children.</li><li><strong>Forgive Yourself:</strong> Remember that you’re doing your best, and it’s okay to&nbsp;feel overwhelmed. Be&nbsp;kind to&nbsp;yourself as&nbsp;you navigate this new chapter in&nbsp;your life.</li></ul><p>Being a&nbsp;mother comes with significant responsibility and can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;challenging job.
