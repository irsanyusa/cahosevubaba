Returning for the premiere season of Britain’s Got Talent: The Champions, the pair blew the judges away yet again. The octogenarian and her dance partner aced another spectacular salsa routine in the prelims. Their exhilarating act was such a celebration of life it earned the duo ANOTHER golden buzzer. What other success has the pair seen?</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-returning-to-do-it-again>Returning to Do it Again</h2><p>Paddy Jones, 86, and Nico Espinosa, 46, had a history of success before we <a href=# class=broken_link>first met them on BGT</a>. They had been wowing judging panels all over the world before auditioning for the show. So certainly receiving the <a href=#>golden buzzer a second time</a>, returning for “BGT: The Champions” was nothing new for them.</p><p>Like the first audition, the pair took the stage for another salsa number certain to have most grannie’s saying “Oouff.” The routine starts, with Nico highlighting some of his solo moves, while Paddy gets escorted to the stage by her stud entourage.</p><p>For the remainder of the 2-minutes, the pair execute some fast-paced footwork peppered in with Paddy delivering many flips and spins sure to make you gasp. It was as inspirational and captivating as their time on season 8, ending to a standing ovation from the crowd. They didn’t have to wait long for judges to decide their fate as David Walliams gave them the golden buzzer immediately. Telling them they are one of “the most joyous, most beautiful, most life-affirming acts ever had,” just before securing their place in the final.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-success-of-paddy-and-nico>The Success of Paddy and Nico</h3><p>After receiving the golden buzzer in “BGT: The Champions,” Paddy and Nico went on to the Grand Finale. They ended finishing in the bottom seven in the tough line-up of acts. It was not long after that we got to see them returning to the BGT stage. They were invited back for the second “BGT: The Champions” last year.</p><p>Unfortunately, this time the pair did not make it out of the preliminaries. Despite not winning “BGT” the pair have won a television competition title when they competed on the Spanish talent show, “Tu Si Que Vales.” They also earned many international dancing accolades and honors. Paddy also now holds a world record as the oldest acrobatic salsa dancer. There’s no doubt that Nico has helped Paddy live out her “golden” years and maybe there’s more to come.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/The-Masked-Dancer-UK-2.jpeg alt="First Look at ‘The Masked Dancer UK’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570p6aqKaUYq%2BowIygpqWclaN6o8HZs5yrZZakv26%2FwKWqmmWjmru0rdOipqerXaWupbDYZpinnF2jtqS7jKKqZqiipLynec6fZKWhlpp8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
