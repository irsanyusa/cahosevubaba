This dark horse has done everything in his career from opening for Andrea Bocelli in Germany, to leaving the music scene to care for his niece. Jeremy’s rise on NBC’s <a href=#>The Voice</a> teaches us that sometimes your true purpose will not let you get off course for too long.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Nearly a decade ago, the 29-year-old competed on the <a href=#>American Idol </a>stage, coming in 13th place. With a new mindset, Jeremy now earned himself a spot in the top 10 of the 21st season of The Voice.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to his impressive performances including renditions of Celine Dion’s ‘Because You Loved Me,’ which he dedicated to his father and brought judge <a href=# class=broken_link>Kelly Clarkson</a> to tears, to his R&B spin on Cory Asbury’s, ‘Reckless Love,’ Jeremy is a fan favorite to win the show.&nbsp;</p><p>“You are always wonderful. You sing perfectly in your element, this is the most passionate performance you have ever given,” coach <a href=#>John Legend</a> said about Jeremy’s ‘Reckless Love’ performance.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/MYdD6rWl7QA</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jeremy-rosado-comes-full-circle-on-team-kelly>Jeremy Rosado Comes Full-Circle on Team Kelly</h2><p>With the pressure on, Jeremy continues to show that he is the one to beat this season. His performances often garner praise from every judge.</p><p>“Your voice is so flawless. You are doing what you love,” said Clarkson.</p><p>Jeremy shared that he remembers watching Clarkson announced as American Idol‘s first winner. Earning a spot on Team Kelly is a full circle moment for the former Idol singer. Jeremy loves Clarkson’s genuine spirit and says she is incredible to work with.</p><p>“It’s just crazy because she’s such an amazing human being. When the cameras are on. When the cameras are off. She’s the same person,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeremy said</a>.&nbsp; “That’s just one of the greatest things I’ve gotten to tell her is how much she means to me on a personal level.”</p><p>Jeremy has also spoken candidly about his love for God saying that he knows God is on his side going into the final weeks of the show. With fierce competition from other contestants such as his knockout round sparring partner, <a href=#>Jershika Maple</a>, who was saved by Legend, Jeremy is hoping to make us all believe in second chances.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-29-at-2.51.jpg alt="‘Strictly Come Dancing’ to Air Christmas Special with ‘The Voice UK’s Anne-Marie" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Kelly Clarkson</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Voice</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZq6fnrCmecGrnJqjn6rBbr%2FTmqlmopWnsq7FjKumrJmUpHqxvsSvoKito6HGbq%2FOpqeerJWZerC6jJqknqqZmK6vecidpqVn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
