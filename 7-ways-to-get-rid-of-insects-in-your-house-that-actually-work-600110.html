We&nbsp;all want to&nbsp;keep our houses pest-free, but the chemical pesticides we&nbsp;can get from stores are way too toxic and harmful to&nbsp;use anywhere near your home, family, and pets. If&nbsp;these chemicals can kill insects, surely they cannot be&nbsp;good for&nbsp;us, and it’s better to&nbsp;use something natural and safe to&nbsp;repel bugs and insects whenever possible.</p><p>Our <strong>Bright Side </strong>team<strong> </strong>wants to&nbsp;show you these simple, easy, safe, and effective tricks to&nbsp;get these household insects and bugs out of&nbsp;your home once and for all.</p><p><h2>1. Cockroaches</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/314/387/f5d1e951499985de7994cc97c1.jpg><p>Cockroaches are not only disgusting insects to&nbsp;see in&nbsp;your house, but they can also carry very harmful diseases like E.coli and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>trigger</a> asthma and allergic reactions. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>believed</a> that this bug can survive just about anything, and if&nbsp;we&nbsp;don’t exterminate them from our homes, it&nbsp;can rapidly become a&nbsp;pest.</p><p>These insects are very <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>adaptable</a> and manage to&nbsp;survive in&nbsp;extreme situations, such as&nbsp;temperatures of&nbsp;32°F, they can hold their breath for up&nbsp;to&nbsp;40&nbsp;minutes, and they can live without their heads until they die of&nbsp;thirst. It’s no&nbsp;wonder why most humans fear them, so&nbsp;to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;them, there are many products you can buy from the store but they are usually highly toxic. We&nbsp;found some ways you can use to&nbsp;prevent them from coming into your home without having to&nbsp;use harmful products.</p><ul><li><strong>Seal small holes and keep your home clean</strong>. Cockroaches <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>may</a> enter your house through cracks and drains; they can also enter whenever they smell crumbs of&nbsp;food you left on&nbsp;the floor or&nbsp;any part of&nbsp;the kitchen. That’s why sealing any cracks and cleanliness are very important to&nbsp;try to&nbsp;keep them away.</li></ul><ul><li>If&nbsp;you already have some of&nbsp;these bugs in&nbsp;your home, this <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>trick</a> is&nbsp;very cheap and safe, and most importantly, it&nbsp;works to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;them. Chop one onion and add one tsp of&nbsp;<a href=# title="baking soda" data-link=tag>baking soda</a>, and put this mixture in&nbsp;the corners of&nbsp;your house. Reapply it&nbsp;daily and your home should be&nbsp;roach-free very soon.</li></ul><p><h2>2. Ticks</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/034/da2/12becf5b6e9b28a941656c50d3.jpg><p>Ticks can be&nbsp;very different in&nbsp;size and color. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;very important to&nbsp;protect yourself, your family, and your pets from these little nasties, as&nbsp;they may be&nbsp;very harmful and sometimes even deadly. If&nbsp;you are not very keen on&nbsp;applying chemical pesticides to&nbsp;your skin or&nbsp;on&nbsp;your pets’ fur, try these natural and safe <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mixtures</a> to&nbsp;prevent these annoying creatures from getting into your home.</p><ul><li>Tick repellent for humans</li></ul><p>Mix 20&nbsp;drops of&nbsp;rose geranium essential oil, 10&nbsp;drops of&nbsp;sweetgrass essential oil, 5&nbsp;drops of&nbsp;<a href=# title=lavender data-link=tag>lavender</a> essential oil, 5&nbsp;drops of&nbsp;citronella or&nbsp;lemon essential oil, and one tbsp of&nbsp;rubbing alcohol, and dilute it&nbsp;to&nbsp;100&nbsp;ml with <a href=# title=vinegar data-link=tag>vinegar</a> or&nbsp;water. Then transfer it&nbsp;into a&nbsp;spray bottle. Shake well and spray it&nbsp;on&nbsp;your clothes before leaving your house.</p><ul><li>Tick repellent for dogs</li></ul><p>Dogs seem to&nbsp;always be&nbsp;targeted by&nbsp;ticks, so&nbsp;check your furry friend frequently, especially after walks at&nbsp;the park. You don’t want any of&nbsp;these bugs invading your home.</p><p>Mix 20&nbsp;drops of&nbsp;rose geranium and pennyroyal essential oil with 2&nbsp;tbsp of&nbsp;almond oil, and place a&nbsp;few drops of&nbsp;it&nbsp;on&nbsp;your dog or&nbsp;on&nbsp;their collar.</p><p><strong>Do&nbsp;not use it&nbsp;on&nbsp;cats or&nbsp;pregnant animals.</strong></p><p><h2>3. Garden pests</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/102/9bb/688cac54079071871039a9e92d.jpg><p>Imagine putting so&nbsp;much effort into planting a&nbsp;garden at&nbsp;your house and some bugs ruin it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the blink of&nbsp;an&nbsp;eye. Certainly, there are many pesticides available to&nbsp;keep the cultivated area in&nbsp;your home intact, but the use of&nbsp;them can make fruits and vegetables inedible.</p><p>There are many different types of&nbsp;garden pests out there, so&nbsp;it’s better to&nbsp;do&nbsp;some research on&nbsp;the most common ones to&nbsp;be&nbsp;prepared for when they come for your produce. We&nbsp;have some tips for when you decide to&nbsp;start your own garden.</p><ul><li>Mix 1/2&nbsp;a cup of&nbsp;hot peppers with 1/2&nbsp;a cup of&nbsp;garlic or&nbsp;onion, then blend it&nbsp;until it&nbsp;turns into a&nbsp;paste. Mix the paste with 500&nbsp;ml of&nbsp;warm water. Let it&nbsp;sit for 24&nbsp;hours in&nbsp;a&nbsp;warm place, strain&nbsp;it, and spray your plants with this <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>liquid</a> to&nbsp;keep unpleasant bugs away.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Inspect your garden regularly and </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>build</strong></a><strong> a&nbsp;natural bug-predator habitat</strong>. Using nature in&nbsp;your favor is&nbsp;the best thing you can&nbsp;do. That being said, take note of&nbsp;the natural food chain and keep pests’ predators, like frogs, snakes, birds, toads, etc., close to&nbsp;your crops. Also, scraping off any “bad bugs” or&nbsp;eggs can stop new insects from appearing.</li></ul><p><h2>4. Spiders</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/82a/8f2/02ac885b56ae6884bb81782c27.jpg><p>Even if&nbsp;you don’t get poisonous <a href=# title=spiders data-link=tag>spiders</a> in&nbsp;your area, you most likely would still appreciate knowing that they can’t come into your house. They can get absolutely anywhere, and even the smallest ones are really scary. Although, it’s important to&nbsp;know that spiders are natural <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>predators</a> of&nbsp;insects, so&nbsp;maybe having some in&nbsp;your house or&nbsp;garden can be&nbsp;beneficial to&nbsp;you and your plants.</p><p>Most spiders are not a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>threat</a> to&nbsp;humans since their bite equates to&nbsp;the bite of&nbsp;a&nbsp;mosquito, but in&nbsp;real life, if&nbsp;we&nbsp;are bitten by&nbsp;a&nbsp;spider, we&nbsp;wouldn’t turn into a&nbsp;superhero. Dying from a&nbsp;spider bite is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very rare occurrence, but if&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;keep them away from you, there are nontoxic tricks we&nbsp;can use to&nbsp;prevent these 8-legged friends from entering and living in&nbsp;our homes.</p><ul><li>This natural <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>repellent</a> won’t kill the spiders but it&nbsp;will keep them away since these terrifying insects don’t like strong smells. Add 5-10 drops of&nbsp;peppermint oil into a&nbsp;mix of&nbsp;200&nbsp;ml of&nbsp;water and 1/4 tsp of&nbsp;liquid detergent, shake it&nbsp;well, and spray the affected areas once a&nbsp;week until you get rid of&nbsp;all the spiders. The peppermint oil can be&nbsp;substituted with eucalyptus, citronella, lavender, or&nbsp;tea tree oil.</li></ul><p><h2>5. Ants</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fec/5ed/6225125ca9b1da50ac689ee5ef.jpg><p><a href=# title=Ants data-link=tag>Ants</a> can be&nbsp;very annoying and can suddenly appear from out of&nbsp;nowhere, oftentimes sneaking into places in&nbsp;your kitchen or&nbsp;pantry by&nbsp;leaving a&nbsp;path for their friends into your home. Although ants don’t present a&nbsp;serious threat to&nbsp;humans, they can contaminate food and damage property, and depending on&nbsp;the species, their bites can cause allergic reactions.</p><p>If&nbsp;ants are attracted to&nbsp;your beautiful kitchen, there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;less appealing to&nbsp;them so&nbsp;that there aren’t any ants partying in&nbsp;your household.</p><p>Apparently, ants absolutely hate the smell of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cinnamon</a>. Put some cinnamon powder in&nbsp;the areas of&nbsp;your house where you think the ants enter from. For more effective results, you can get some essential oil and add it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the cinnamon powder. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;side effect, you’ll get a&nbsp;very nice earthy smell in&nbsp;the air.</p><p>If&nbsp;you don’t feel like throwing cinnamon powder and making a&nbsp;mess on&nbsp;the floor, using a&nbsp;cotton swap to&nbsp;mark a&nbsp;straight line or&nbsp;using a&nbsp;cinnamon stick can help too.</p><p><h2>6. Dust mites</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2b3/430/6a18a35b4abb46802cb358da86.jpg><p>These <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bugs</a> are so&nbsp;tiny that we&nbsp;can’t even see them with the naked eye, but unfortunately, it&nbsp;doesn’t mean that these tiny insects are not in&nbsp;your house. They live in&nbsp;household dust, prefer warmer places, and their favorite food is&nbsp;skin flakes. So&nbsp;guess where they like to&nbsp;be? That’s right, on&nbsp;your bed!</p><p>Although dust mites don’t bite, many specialists believe that they can cause allergic reactions and skin irritations. Even if&nbsp;you are not allergic to&nbsp;them, you most likely would prefer not to&nbsp;share your house with these little bugs.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Mix</a> 6&nbsp;tsp of&nbsp;eucalyptus oil with 1.5 tsp of&nbsp;liquid laundry detergent in&nbsp;1&nbsp;bucket of&nbsp;water and soak the washable items, then wash it&nbsp;as&nbsp;normal. For anything unwashable, just spray and wipe it&nbsp;with a&nbsp;clean cloth. If&nbsp;you don’t like the smell of&nbsp;eucalyptus oil, you can substitute it&nbsp;with tea tree oil, which is&nbsp;just as&nbsp;effective at&nbsp;getting rid of&nbsp;the pest.</p><p><h2>7. Weevils</h2></p><p>If&nbsp;you leave flour, cereal, or&nbsp;rice unsealed in&nbsp;the pantry, you might end up&nbsp;with these unwanted bugs in&nbsp;your food. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Weevils</a> prefer grains and seeds but can also appear in&nbsp;flour or&nbsp;even pancake mix. Sometimes you can’t even <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tell</a> if&nbsp;you have a&nbsp;weevil pest because they mostly hide within the seeds&nbsp;— the females hide their eggs inside and when the insects are old enough, they eat their way out of&nbsp;the seed.</p><p>You certainly don’t want chemical pesticides anywhere near your food, but these tricks can be&nbsp;good solutions to&nbsp;keep these insects away.</p><ul><li>Apparently, weevils really don’t like the smell of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bay leaves or&nbsp;cloves</a>. <strong>Drop a&nbsp;clove or&nbsp;a&nbsp;bay leaf on&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;your food</strong> and around containers to&nbsp;keep these things away from your home.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Freezing or&nbsp;heating stored </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>foods</strong></a><strong> </strong>can also be&nbsp;effective. If&nbsp;you suspect that your food is&nbsp;falling victim to&nbsp;weevils and you want to&nbsp;kill the insects, you can heat the food up&nbsp;to&nbsp;140°F, or&nbsp;you can put the infested food in&nbsp;the freezer for 3&nbsp;days, and that should do&nbsp;it.</li></ul><p><h2>8. Drain flies</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/900/431/11502157e0a13ee3e4389dd391.jpg><p>As&nbsp;their name suggests, these flies live in&nbsp;drains, and they mostly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>live</a> in&nbsp;our bathrooms or&nbsp;kitchens. Some people think these little fellas are very cute, and that might be&nbsp;because of&nbsp;their size and fur, but they can be&nbsp;pretty annoying to&nbsp;live with.</p><p>These insects feed off of&nbsp;bacteria and normally live in&nbsp;wet or&nbsp;humid areas. Many people don’t know, but these animals can <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>help</a> in&nbsp;the water cleaning process at&nbsp;sewage treatment plants. There are natural ways in&nbsp;which you can get them out of&nbsp;your house.</p><ul><li>To&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;them and prevent them from reappearing, you have to<strong>&nbsp;clean and sanitize your sinks first</strong>. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Mix</a> 1/2&nbsp;a cup of&nbsp;baking soda and <a href=# title=salt data-link=tag>salt</a> with 1&nbsp;cup of&nbsp;vinegar, and use warm water to&nbsp;flush the mixture.</li></ul><ul><li>Now to&nbsp;trap and kill the older moths that are flying or&nbsp;jumping in&nbsp;your bath, <strong>you can </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>use</strong></a><strong> <a href=# title="apple cider vinegar" data-link=tag>apple cider vinegar</a></strong>. Fill a&nbsp;bowl with vinegar and cover it&nbsp;with plastic wrap. Poke some holes into the plastic cover with a&nbsp;toothpick. Leave the trap in&nbsp;the room where the moths are&nbsp;— they will enter through the holes and won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;scape.</li></ul><p>Which one of&nbsp;these tricks did you find most useful to&nbsp;keep bugs out of&nbsp;your home?
