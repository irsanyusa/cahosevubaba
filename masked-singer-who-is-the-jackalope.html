Talking as a kid “wasn’t her jam,” she explained as she held up vines. Growing up, she expressed herself through music and dance. We see what looks like a TikTok or social media frame on the shot.</p><p>A clapboard comes in with “MYSTERY” written on it. Pretty soon people all over the world began connecting with her! Two men in black walk up wearing headbands and sweatbands. This Jackalope “don’t lie!” She created a “modern family of fellow outcasts.” One of the men in black holds a red heart necklace with a “G” on it. Jackalope claims to have a thick skin, then we see a framed photo of the Scream mask. Her moves “shine brightest on Wednesdays.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WHO IS ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ MEDUSA?

Then, Count Von Count gave a clue that said “30 under 30.” She explained that she was on the same list as Donald Glover, Emma Stone, and Michael B. Jordan.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-4f352515-790c-422a-a895-5110a1a3c01b>Popular Guesses for&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Jackalope</h2><p>Nicole seemed to think she knew who the Jackalope is. She predicted that it’s “her girl” Lele Pons! Guest panelist Jennifer Nettles thought it might Camila Cabello. Jenny guessed it was Jenny Ortega, based on her connection to Wednesday and the Scream franchise. Online, a lot of fans agreed with Nicole that it was Lele Pons or that it could be Jenna Ortega or Sara Hyland. All these options were brought up by the judges, so they must be on to something this week!</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WHO IS ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ CALIFORNIA ROLL?
