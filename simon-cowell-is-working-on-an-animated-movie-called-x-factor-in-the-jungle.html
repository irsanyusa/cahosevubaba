The project is inspired by the talent show, with animals taking center stage.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-simon-cowell-working-on-animated-x-factor-movie>Simon Cowell Working on Animated X Factor Movie</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, the upcoming movie shows what happens when a karaoke machine ends up in the jungle. A sing-off between a mouse, jaguar, and rhino leads to a singing contest attended by a huge audience of animals.</p><p>The film is written by Sean Catherine Derek (known for the Batman animated series) and directed by Kirk Wise (known for Disney titles such as Beauty and the Beast and The Hunchback of Notre Dame). Cowell and Threshold partner Jimmy Ienner will manage music collaboration.</p><p>“I have loved this idea since I first was approached by Larry and the team at Threshold, and I’m delighted GFM Animation love it too,” Cowell said in a statement. “We all share the same vision for this fun, positive, family-friendly movie, and of course I’m equally really excited for the soundtrack too. I’ve always wanted to make animated movies and I plan for this to be the first of many!”</p><p>Pre-production for X Factor in the Jungle will reportedly begin this year, with animation starting next year. The plan is to distribute the film in 2026.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SIMON COWELL SAYS NIALL HORAN COULDN’T HAVE MADE IT THROUGH HIS ‘X FACTOR’ AUDITION IF NOT FOR HIM</a></strong></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Animated Movie ‘X Factor in the Jungle’ Greenlit by GFM Animation, Larry Kasanoff’s Threshold, Simon Cowell’s Syco (EXCLUSIVE) <a href=#>https://t.co/VJNo3BYiVh</a></p>— Variety (@Variety) <a href=#>May 18, 2023</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-will-the-show-ever-return>Will the Show Ever Return?</h2><p>Now that Cowell is working on an animated version of The X Factor, can we expect the live-action show to return? There’s been talk of both the UK and USA versions of the show coming back to our TV screens at some point.</p><p>Last year, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cowell told Talent Recap</a> that he could “possibly” be returning to judge The X Factor, explaining that it’s “more likely than not” that the show would be coming back. Then earlier this year, it was reported that Cowell was in talks for a new contract with Channel 5 in the UK.</p><p>Cowell has also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">teased the return </a>of The X Factor USA last year, saying NBC offered to air a new season of the show. It’s now been 10 years since the American version went off the air after three seasons. No official dates have been announced for either version of the show.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Original_RyanGosling_Gabe-GinsbergGetty-Images-220x147.jpeg alt="Ryan Gosling Has a Song on the ‘Barbie’ Movie Soundtrack" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>simon cowell</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the x factor</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570qKkqKZdmLy4sculZKKrXay8s7fIp55mp55irq95wKegppmkmrFuuc6voJ5lk5a5rbHDZq9mnpGYwbC%2BjKKlZqyYmnqrwc2go55n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
