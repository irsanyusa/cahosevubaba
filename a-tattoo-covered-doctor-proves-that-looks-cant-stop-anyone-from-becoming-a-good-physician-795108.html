She graduated from the University of&nbsp;Adelaide, Australia, and is&nbsp;considered one of&nbsp;the most tattooed women who practice medicine. She has become popular all over the world not only for the number of&nbsp;tattoos on&nbsp;her skin but because she has broken some prejudices perpetuated by&nbsp;society. So, while achieving her dream of&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;doctor, she also teaches society that having tattoos doesn’t damage one’s potential or&nbsp;professionalism at&nbsp;all.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> arranged an&nbsp;exclusive interview with Sarah to&nbsp;tell you more about what she thinks regarding taboos, tattoos, and job inclusion.</p><p><h2>What other professionals think about her appearance</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/aa1/b95/00e2ae5d588d7f314337e63554.jpg><p>Sarah told&nbsp;us that her colleagues welcomed her with open arms and that everything has been pleasing thus far. She was accepted for who she was, which is&nbsp;“colorful,” as&nbsp;she creatively calls herself. In&nbsp;fact, she recently had an&nbsp;interview with her superiors and managed to&nbsp;get her first preferential surgical job. She added, “They obviously didn’t let my&nbsp;appearance compromise my&nbsp;potential.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f49/a8a/7bedc85403bd48e3507fa5e3e7.jpg><p><h2>Her looks have allowed her to&nbsp;have varied experiences.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5b3/8e8/779c985f20a382324ad11152f9.jpg><p>Thanks to&nbsp;her artistic body, Sarah has more positive than negative experiences to&nbsp;share. But even&nbsp;so, she has faced awkward situations here and there. For example, once she was at&nbsp;an&nbsp;event that took place in&nbsp;an&nbsp;Australian restaurant, and both she and her husband were asked to&nbsp;leave. This is&nbsp;additional proof that there are still taboos against looks that fall too far from the standards set by&nbsp;society.</p><p>But not everything is&nbsp;bad or&nbsp;uncomfortable for the doctor. Thanks to&nbsp;her great talent, Sarah succeeded at&nbsp;opening her own <a href=# title=art data-link=tag>art</a> <a href=#>studio</a> where she tattoos other people. She also won the “Miss Ink Australia” <a href=#>contest</a> in&nbsp;2017&nbsp;and, of&nbsp;course, has received unconditional support from all the people she lives with on&nbsp;a&nbsp;daily basis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e56/65d/5702ed5e13b379f9a66ad56e6f.jpg><p><h2>A&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;advice for those who think they can’t achieve their dreams because of&nbsp;their appearance</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/317/250/9f5d3e5ffa8aa93d876ef87012.jpg><p>As&nbsp;Sarah said, “If&nbsp;you want something and work hard for&nbsp;it, you can get&nbsp;it. The more people help to&nbsp;eliminate the limits set by&nbsp;stereotypes, the more they’ll be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;change the way people think in&nbsp;the future.” And she’s right! To&nbsp;change others’ opinions, people have to&nbsp;keep contributing, working, and demonstrating that what’s different isn’t bad.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c46/e60/83fa2f57b19a8ae3fa8a3a54ed.jpg><p><h2>“If&nbsp;you have nothing good to&nbsp;say, then don’t say anything at&nbsp;all!”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/312/8f5/267d1f5bcdbf36acac4ffc6cc0.jpg><p>Art has always been part of&nbsp;this world and in&nbsp;many forms. However, it’s not always accepted openly, either because it’s too subjective, strange, or&nbsp;because it&nbsp;differs too much from everyday life. For artists like Sarah, creativity is&nbsp;a&nbsp;form of&nbsp;self-expression that should be&nbsp;exhibited to&nbsp;the fullest and not be&nbsp;judged or&nbsp;rejected since this demonstrates the true character of&nbsp;a&nbsp;person.</p><p><h2>Bonus: Taboos regarding tattoos are real, according to&nbsp;a&nbsp;study.</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;the past, tattoos were seen as&nbsp;signs of&nbsp;crime or&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;prove social status. Often, this made it&nbsp;hard for people to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;job or&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;taken seriously. However, according to&nbsp;one <a href=#>study</a>, the stigma surrounding tattoos still exists, even though we&nbsp;live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;more modern era that’s open to&nbsp;change.</p><p>Have you suffered from discrimination because of&nbsp;your tattoos, hairstyle, or&nbsp;overall looks?
