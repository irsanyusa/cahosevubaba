They decided to&nbsp;make losing weight their New Year’s goal after Jasmine saw a&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;herself she didn’t like. Their story shows that everyone is&nbsp;lovely as&nbsp;they are, but it’s also okay to&nbsp;work towards a&nbsp;body that makes you feel even better and happier. Let’s see their “before and after” photos.</p><p><h2>The couple loses 215 pounds (97.5&nbsp;kg), swapping bad habits for exercise.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/395/411/78c7b05866a6969910a3cbdc2a.jpg><p>Jasmine Parent <a href=# title=focused data-link=tag>focused</a> on&nbsp;getting fit after finishing <a href=# title=college data-link=tag>college</a> in&nbsp;2012. However, a&nbsp;year later, she faced the loss of&nbsp;her father due to&nbsp;<a href=# title=cancer data-link=tag>cancer</a>. Struggling with her sadness, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>found</a> solace in&nbsp;food, causing her weight to&nbsp;increase gradually. “I&nbsp;started to&nbsp;emotionally eat, I&nbsp;didn’t realize how unhappy or&nbsp;how <a href=# title=anxious data-link=tag>anxious</a>&nbsp;I was because it&nbsp;was just my&nbsp;norm.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7b4/d5c/160af5554f94bc83ebdddacd25.jpg><p>Later, she became pregnant and added 50&nbsp;pounds (22.7&nbsp;kg) to&nbsp;her weight. In&nbsp;2016, after giving birth to&nbsp;her daughter, she soon became pregnant again, without shedding the weight gained during her initial pregnancy. When she left the hospital after delivering her second daughter, her weight had reached 300&nbsp;pounds. Despite the happiness of&nbsp;completing her family, she was dissatisfied with her appearance and how she felt.</p><p><h2>Jasmine then felt unhappy with her body.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/738/383/f03158522981ce9ad6f05cf45e.jpg><p>Looking at&nbsp;herself in&nbsp;the mirror, she experienced significant discomfort. Her knees and back were in&nbsp;pain, and she constantly felt fatigued. Additionally, her anxiety had become so&nbsp;overwhelming that she was hesitant to&nbsp;leave her house.</p><p>Jasmine <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>realized</a> the need to&nbsp;lose weight after seeing a&nbsp;Christmas photo of&nbsp;herself. She and her childhood friends took a&nbsp;picture during their reunion every year. But when she saw the photo, she felt sad and decided to&nbsp;take action.</p><p><h2>Feeling down, she spoke to&nbsp;her partner, Jeremy Crawley. They chose a&nbsp;New Year’s resolution: lose weight.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c61/cff/d3cfcf5506b223c87e8ec3d46f.jpg><p>Crawley, who stands at&nbsp;6&nbsp;feet 5&nbsp;inches tall, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>weighed</a> over 300 pounds (136&nbsp;kg) and shared the same feelings as&nbsp;Parent. So&nbsp;she began looking into ways to&nbsp;make changes. She found a&nbsp;strategy that seemed suitable for their lives.</p><p>This plan outlined what foods to&nbsp;eat and which ones to&nbsp;avoid. They started by&nbsp;cutting out sugar, junk, and processed foods and instead <strong>added vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains, and lean meats like chicken and turkey</strong>. Within the first week, Parent noticed a&nbsp;difference.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/988/1fc/0961d857a1900bce91b9e6271b.jpg><p>“I&nbsp;had more energy and was more focused,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;month, Jasmine <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lost</a> 17&nbsp;lbs (7.7&nbsp;kg), while Jeremy shed 20&nbsp;lbs (9&nbsp;kg). This motivated them to&nbsp;start exercising. They began with 25-minute home workout DVDs.</p><p>Jeremy supported Jasmine, even though it&nbsp;was tough for her at&nbsp;294 lbs (133&nbsp;kg). When their progress slowed, they adjusted their routines and supported each other through challenges.</p><p><h2>Hard work always pays off.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/80d/603/e5c61355a5ae33660c87cbf644.jpg><p>In&nbsp;just 10&nbsp;months, Jasmine went from 294 lbs to&nbsp;174 lbs (133&nbsp;kg to&nbsp;79&nbsp;kg), losing an&nbsp;impressive 120 lbs (54&nbsp;kg). Jeremy also made progress, shedding 95&nbsp;lbs (43&nbsp;kg). Jasmine emphasized that her weight loss didn’t come from quick fixes or&nbsp;trendy diets. She acknowledged the hard work and effort required, but found it&nbsp;all to&nbsp;be&nbsp;worthwhile.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/077/b0d/d63bda53a4b1e9634aa82a2ccc.jpg><p>Both Jasmine and Jeremy shared their transformations on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Instagram</a>, gaining Jasmine over 160,000&nbsp;followers. Recently, she posted a&nbsp;throwback photo in&nbsp;a&nbsp;swimsuit alongside a&nbsp;more recent bikini picture, revealing that they were celebrating their weight loss with a&nbsp;vacation in&nbsp;Montego Bay, Jamaica.</p><h2>“I&nbsp;am happy with how I&nbsp;look. I&nbsp;am happy with how I&nbsp;feel. I&nbsp;am just overall happy,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/94b/59f/42e4925fd3a8b495b809698fe5.jpg><p>Everybody is&nbsp;beautiful in&nbsp;their own unique way. Each person’s body is&nbsp;special and should be&nbsp;celebrated. It’s important to&nbsp;embrace and love ourselves just as&nbsp;we&nbsp;are.
