That’s the phrase that everyone utters when they watch an episode of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" label="The Masked Singer (opens in a new tab)" href=# class=broken_link>The Masked Singer</a> and are dying to know which celebrity will be unmasked. The judging panel offers diverse opinions and comedic commentary that make the show fun and exciting.

Her 25-year career has seen a multitude of television appearances. Up until this past year, she has been a correspondent on Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve special. This coupled with her radio show and multiple books that she’s put out have no doubt brought in some big bucks for her. With her appearance on season three of The Masked Singer, her net worth has definitely risen from its <a href=#>estimated $14 million in 2019.</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Robin Thicke on ‘The Masked Singer’</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>It may be shocking to know that Robin Thicke is presumed to be the highest-paid judge.

His lengthy music career makes him provide his music expertise when trying to make guesses on the show. Robin has collaborated with a ton of artists including <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="season three contestant Lil Wayne.
