Over time, it&nbsp;has become a&nbsp;reference for modern cinema due to&nbsp;its multiple recognitions and awards. Despite this, not even a&nbsp;production of&nbsp;such magnitude is&nbsp;spared from making mistakes. Thanks to&nbsp;their eagle eye, viewers have noticed what diehard fans will see as&nbsp;critical oversights.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> uncovered 20&nbsp;mistakes that can be&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;spot unless you’re a&nbsp;true <i>Titanic</i> fan.</p><p><h2>1. Etiquette mistakes</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b01/9b7/94dd395646bf7c880013d9b20a.jpg><p><i>Titanic</i>’s plot revolves around members of&nbsp;different social classes falling for each other. Rose and her mother, Ruth DeWitt Bukater (played by&nbsp;actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Frances Fisher</a>), belong to&nbsp;a&nbsp;privileged stratum, so&nbsp;they are supposed to&nbsp;know the <a href=# title=etiquette data-link=tag>etiquette</a> protocols very well. In&nbsp;fact, on&nbsp;several occasions, Mrs. Ruth reminds others to&nbsp;comply with them. That’s why it&nbsp;seems <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>contradictory</a> that in&nbsp;several parts of&nbsp;the film, she wears gloves to&nbsp;snack when the rules of&nbsp;etiquette forbid this: she should take them off when entering any room where food is&nbsp;offered.</p><p><h2>2. The disappearing crowd</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/910/809/212a7254ea90d05edd18ea8da0.jpg><p>At&nbsp;the movie’s beginning, thousands of&nbsp;people gather to&nbsp;say goodbye to&nbsp;their loved ones and watch them depart aboard the Titanic. But if&nbsp;you take a&nbsp;closer look at&nbsp;the scene where Jack and his friend Fabrizio, played by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Danny Nucci</a>, are playing cards to&nbsp;win their lucky tickets, you can see the ship through the window. However, the crowd isn’t there. Where did they all disappear&nbsp;to?</p><p>That we&nbsp;don’t know, but the crowd is&nbsp;back on&nbsp;the dock when Jack and Fabrizio board the huge ship to&nbsp;embark on&nbsp;their new adventure.</p><p><h2>3. Changes in&nbsp;the smokestack</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b86/886/34da3f542e94379e7553146b65.jpg><p>Like the guardrails and the bow, the smokestack of&nbsp;the boat also seems to&nbsp;take on&nbsp;a&nbsp;life of&nbsp;its own. At&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the film, the shape of&nbsp;the smokestack is&nbsp;different from what we&nbsp;see as&nbsp;the ship begins to&nbsp;sink. Remembering and preserving the set’s exact details must have been very complicated and cost a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>fortune</a>, which is&nbsp;why that might have happened.</p><p><h2>4. Objects appearing</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c2d/8ec/34c9cd50d88f74bfd40923a31a.jpg><p>The ship’s officers wrongfully arrest Jack, and Rose rushes to&nbsp;his aid. But producers didn’t notice that a&nbsp;pillow appeared out of&nbsp;nowhere between scenes in&nbsp;the room. Did someone decide to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;quick nap?</p><p><h2>5. The snotsicle</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d3e/6e5/1a9bd053e8947d8da073271f43.jpg><p>Jack and Rose are stranded in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the freezing Atlantic Ocean, where they both struggle to&nbsp;survive while waiting to&nbsp;be&nbsp;rescued. At&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;these scenes, both support each other, and because of&nbsp;the cold temperature, Jack gets what’s come to&nbsp;be&nbsp;known as&nbsp;a&nbsp;snotsicle. But a&nbsp;while later, the ice has melted when Rose tries to&nbsp;wake him up&nbsp;because help has arrived.</p><p><h2>6. Moving guardrails</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bc1/801/a817ef5c7685773fba4242334d.jpg><p>Check out this props oversight. In&nbsp;the first image, Jack Dawson (played by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a>) was standing next to&nbsp;his friend on&nbsp;the ship’s bow, and the guardrails on&nbsp;the sides were separated.</p><p>Later in&nbsp;the film, both protagonists find themselves in&nbsp;the same place to&nbsp;act out one of&nbsp;the most iconic scenes: Jack embraces Rose with the wind blowing on&nbsp;them. But the railings were now attached. Is&nbsp;it&nbsp;possible that the bars were carried away by&nbsp;the love inspired by&nbsp;this shot and decided to&nbsp;embrace each other too?</p><p><h2>7. The cameraman’s reflection</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6e4/ef8/48cff555acad3809a1f18db5c4.jpg><p>In&nbsp;1997, when the film was shot, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>technology</a> was not as&nbsp;advanced as&nbsp;today, and filming a&nbsp;scene required several cameramen following the actors from different angles. One of&nbsp;them can be&nbsp;seen in&nbsp;the reflection of&nbsp;the glass of&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the doors of&nbsp;Titanic. Undoubtedly, this error is&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;spot and edit without today’s apps.</p><p><h2>8. Wrong time of&nbsp;the year</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cb7/dec/372e155aafa10964302977f982.jpg><p>Another wardrobe oversight is&nbsp;Cal Hockley (played by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Billy Zane</a>). This character, due to&nbsp;his jealousy, ruffles Jack’s feathers, referring to&nbsp;his poverty and emphasizing his ordinary manner of&nbsp;dress. But something that causes doubts in&nbsp;this scene is&nbsp;to&nbsp;see him with a&nbsp;dress suit and shoes, but without socks. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;must-have <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>accessory</a> in&nbsp;formal attire, and even more so&nbsp;for the era on&nbsp;which the film was based.</p><p><h2>9. Rose’s nail length</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/990/113/ee069053d2aa4b04e700f45fcf.jpg><p>We&nbsp;know that the movie’s filming lasted several months, so&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Kate Winslet</a>’s nails obviously grew several times. However, for her character Rose, it&nbsp;was barely a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;days. In&nbsp;some scenes, we&nbsp;can see that her nails look short, and the length changes drastically from one scene to&nbsp;the next.</p><p><h2>10. The lake Jack mentions</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b5b/e82/abe0d9544cb1fc946dd9cbec37.jpg><p>When Jack tries to&nbsp;dissuade Rose from jumping into the icy waters of&nbsp;the Atlantic, he&nbsp;mentions ice fishing on&nbsp;Lake <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Wissota</a>. The small detail is&nbsp;that the lake in&nbsp;question is&nbsp;artificial and was not created until 1917, while the Titanic sank in&nbsp;1912. Something similar is&nbsp;true of&nbsp;the Santa Monica roller coaster that Jack promises to&nbsp;take Rose on. In&nbsp;reality, it&nbsp;was not built until 1916.</p><p><h2>11. The ship’s bow</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/490/362/55ac2054b5863567a529693da1.jpg><p>As&nbsp;we&nbsp;will find out later, the film set had quite a&nbsp;few logistical and design oversights. An&nbsp;example of&nbsp;that is&nbsp;how the bow changes. It&nbsp;definitely doesn’t look quite the same when <a href=# title="Leonardo DiCaprio" data-link=tag>Leonardo DiCaprio</a>’s character is&nbsp;excitedly watching the dolphins jump, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;does in&nbsp;Jack and Rose’s iconic romantic <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>moment</a>.</p><p><h2>12. Jack’s hair</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/210/f12/418303557ca807c2730f7661dd.jpg><p>Another curious continuity error is&nbsp;Jack’s hairstyle in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the scenes in&nbsp;third class. After his charming dance with little <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Cora</a>, Jack returns to&nbsp;the table, where Rose is&nbsp;waiting for him with his hair disheveled. However, we&nbsp;can see how in&nbsp;the next instant his hair is&nbsp;perfect and even has several layers of&nbsp;styling gel. Many of&nbsp;us would like his power to&nbsp;style our hair in&nbsp;seconds.</p><p><h2>13. The sky</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0ec/552/bcc1e757f28c4c36055fc5f0a9.jpg><p>Astrophysicist <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Neil deGrasse Tyson</a> commented on&nbsp;several errors in&nbsp;the film. For example, they did not consider the date, the course of&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>trip</a>, and the position of&nbsp;the stars as&nbsp;they were seen in&nbsp;the sky that night. The film shows Rose and Jack on&nbsp;a&nbsp;clear, moonless night; according to&nbsp;the expert, this is&nbsp;incorrect.</p><p><h2>14. The disappearing file</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/515/8d4/2300655d7593c4c7d852ba2161.jpg><p>The famous discord drawing had another major continuity error. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Cal</a>, Rose’s fiancé, discovers the picture in&nbsp;a&nbsp;brown folder. When he&nbsp;picks it&nbsp;up, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;enraged and wants to&nbsp;tear it&nbsp;up&nbsp;right then and there. The funny thing is&nbsp;that in&nbsp;the next shot, the folder is&nbsp;gone, and we&nbsp;see the crumpled sheet of&nbsp;paper in&nbsp;Cal’s hand.</p><p><h2>15. The moving mole</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/df8/f62/faa2be59f58b36f4010883880b.jpg><p>One mistake that no&nbsp;one noticed was Rose DeWitt Bukater’s (played by&nbsp;actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Kate Winslet</a>) mole. When the young woman was about to&nbsp;board the boat, her mole was on&nbsp;the left side of&nbsp;her face; however, several shots later, it&nbsp;was on&nbsp;the opposite side.</p><p><h2>16. Reconstructed glass</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/05c/138/70ba7d58e8845ecb496a7d6fe2.jpg><p>In&nbsp;her attempt to&nbsp;free Jack, Rose runs in&nbsp;search of&nbsp;an&nbsp;object that could be&nbsp;useful to&nbsp;save him. She manages to&nbsp;see an&nbsp;axe inside an&nbsp;emergency glass on&nbsp;the wall of&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the corridors. An&nbsp;interesting fact is&nbsp;that the glass is&nbsp;magically reconstructed after it’s broken to&nbsp;reach the axe.</p><p><h2>17. Jack and the disappearing suspenders</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d8a/000/dec24d56a3b6a9a988b90fe4c1.jpg><p>The scene in&nbsp;which Rose frees Jack from the handcuffs has many <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>oversights</a>. Among them is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very obvious continuity error.</p><p>At&nbsp;some point, we&nbsp;can clearly see Jack’s suspenders; in&nbsp;the next shot, when his beloved is&nbsp;about to&nbsp;release him, these are gone. The same thing happens several times in&nbsp;other scenes. Perhaps it&nbsp;would have been simpler not to&nbsp;include the suspenders in&nbsp;the costumes at&nbsp;all.</p><p><h2>18. Gravity-defying ropes</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9f1/185/c654225273aac1af9827beebe1.jpg><p>Something really interesting about this film is&nbsp;that, after the ship suddenly hit the iceberg, it&nbsp;began to&nbsp;sink from the bow; consequently, the stern of&nbsp;the ship was gradually raised, that&nbsp;is, a&nbsp;strong <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>inclination</a> was created from the front that originated the rise of&nbsp;the rear.</p><p>According to&nbsp;the law of&nbsp;gravity, every object should always fall in&nbsp;the direction of&nbsp;the body with the strongest attraction, in&nbsp;this case, the Earth. But in&nbsp;the first image, the ship’s ropes seem to&nbsp;tilt parallel to&nbsp;the Earth. Although later&nbsp;on, we&nbsp;suppose that the producers were more attentive and corrected this mistake.</p><p><h2>19. Uneven angles</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cf6/7eb/52d4ec5030858253aa9326e761.jpg><p>Scenes later, Rose is&nbsp;driven by&nbsp;impulse and is&nbsp;about to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;difficult decision. Luckily, Jack appears to&nbsp;make her reconsider. Now, there is&nbsp;an&nbsp;important detail in&nbsp;this scene: depending on&nbsp;the camera angle, Rose’s hand is&nbsp;either holding the train of&nbsp;her dress or&nbsp;not.</p><p><h2>20. The drawing line</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/421/516/25ac4b5929ae8367fdb1f40ff9.jpg><p>The scene where Jack draws Rose melted the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hearts</a> of&nbsp;thousands of&nbsp;viewers. With emotions running high, it&nbsp;was probably difficult to&nbsp;notice the error in&nbsp;the drawing.</p><p>The first line that Jack draws is&nbsp;quite thick. However, when we&nbsp;see the canvas again, there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;trace of&nbsp;it. The lines are much finer, and the technique is&nbsp;quite polished.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you pay attention to&nbsp;inconsistencies in&nbsp;a&nbsp;film? Do&nbsp;you know of&nbsp;any mistakes we&nbsp;should add to&nbsp;this list?</p><p>The enduring friendship between <a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a> and <a href=# title="Kate Winslet" data-link=tag>Kate Winslet</a> was further solidified by&nbsp;a&nbsp;pivotal comment DiCaprio made about Winslet’s body during their “Titanic” days. Despite facing body-shaming and bullying in&nbsp;her younger years, Winslet found solace in&nbsp;DiCaprio’s remark, emphasizing the importance of&nbsp;her natural shape. This conversation empowered Winslet to&nbsp;champion body positivity, a&nbsp;cause she has passionately advocated for, especially after becoming a&nbsp;mother.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH9xedOipbJlpJ7BorrInGSmoaOprqyx0mapnpmcYrOiutJmqpqvXZbAbq2MoKCgmZ6ptqR5yJycm52inHp5fJhpcGtn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
