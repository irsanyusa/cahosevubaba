By contrast, <b>25%</b> would oppose such a measure, while <b>11%</b> said they didn't know.</p><p>But on which side of this debate did individuals (with views on this topic) stand, and what opinions did they express here in Labs?</p><ul><li>On one hand, many Labs participants thought parents <i>should</i> be punished, on the grounds that they are ultimately responsible for their child’s behaviour, and the threat of punishment would encourage good behaviour – in both the children and the parents</li></ul><ul><li>On the other hand, those who thought that parents should <i>not</i> be punished highlighted the need to tackle any underlying problems that might be causing the truancy, as punishment alone might not solve the problem. They also argued that children wouldn’t learn anything if their parents had to pay for their behaviour, and that it can be difficult to have complete control over your child’s actions anyway.</li></ul><h2><img alt height=3 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.yougov.com/cumulus_uploads/inlineimage/2011-11-09/LabsLine.png width=620 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h2><h2><b><i>Should parents be punished if their child regularly truants from school?

Later on in life it will be the children that miss out on opportunities because of their parents” <i>Anon</i></p><p>“<b>Parents are ultimately responsible for their children and that goes for all aspects of the child’s behaviour.</b> My parents managed to make sure that I attended all my lessons perfectly well” <i>Anon</i></p><p>“Parental responsibility is to <b>ensure child gets to school.</b> Teachers then take over responsibility for child's welfare and education” <i>Chris, M Preston</i></p><p>“The school can't assume responsibility and <b>it would be daft to expect some (not all) children to be fully responsible</b> for themselves” <i>Anon</i></p><p>“<b>Parents have a social responsibility to the community they live in</b> to use taxpayer resources properly e.g. not wasting police resources dealing with the adverse effects of truants”</p><p>“They are responsible by law - <b>not sending children to school is a form of child abuse</b>” <i>Anon</i></p><p>“Parents have to take responsibility for their children attending school. If they do not, <b>it sends the wrong message to the child, who will think that it is not important</b>” <i>Les G, North Yorkshire</i></p><h3><strong>Argument 2: Fines will ‘foster’ good behaviour</strong></h3><p>“Parents <b>should have instilled a good work ethic and an eagerness to learn in children</b> from an early age” <i>Anon</i></p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/istock_childworking_format.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>“If the parents do not have control over their children, then <b>the child's life will spiral out of control early on.</b> School is very important” <i>Chris, Kent</i></p><p><i></i>“<b>Truancy has a long term detrimental impact on both the individual child and often on society</b>. Although parents can't control what the children are doing all the time, they are in a position to foster positive values in their children, and failing to do this is their own fault” <i>Anon</i></p><p>“Maybe <b>showing the parents some discipline will have the effect of prompting them to impose some</b> upon their kids” <i>Anon</i></p><p>“The child is in control, but if the parent is punished then <b>the child sees that their actions cause something to happen to someone that they love, which should change their behaviour” </b><i>Anon</i></p><p>“If society provides parents with benefits and housing, it should demand, in return, that recipients show gratitude by ensuring that they respect society by being law-abiding and respectful citizens. <b>Attending school and being well-behaved there is a very important part of that. Children also need discipline and good role models” </b><i>Laurent, London</i></p><p>“Schools offer a lot of help for parents to get their children to school, so if they won’t work with the school they should pay the price. <b>We have too many children underachieving in school and being absent a lot does not help</b>” <i>Anon</i></p><p>“It <b>instils family values and gives responsibility to the family as a whole</b>.

I believe <b>the child should be punished and from this they will learn their lesson</b>” <i>Emma W, Andover</i></p><p>“Instead of pointing the blame at the parents, <b>a sense of responsibility needs to given to the children themselves</b>. Of course this can only be applied to children over the age of criminal responsibility”</p><p>“Punishing parents <b>does not give a child the idea of consequences for their actions</b> and may cause extra problems in a household where parenting skills need to be improved” <i>Anon</i></p><p>“The issue</p><b>must be taken up with the child and not their parents.</b><p>Additionally, taking benefits away from poorer homes may actually increase truancy by creating an environment where children feel despondent about education and then do not attend school”</p><i>Anon</i><h3><strong>Argument 2: We need to look at the deeper issues</strong></h3><p>“It may not be the parents at fault, for example <b>it could be the school's failure to tackle bullying</b>” <i>Anon, </i><i>Chelmsford</i></p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/PA-shout_form.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>“There are <b>many different social aspects of why children do not want to go into school</b>, and these should be looked at and discussed” <i>Sally B, Essex</i></p><p>“If children are missing school then <b>the bigger issue of why they don't want to attend should be addressed</b>.
