With an overall score of 14.0, it comfortably beat second-placed Cancer Research UK (10.8) and third-placed British Heart Foundation (7.7).</p><p>YouGov’s buzz scores are calculated daily by asking members of the public if they’ve heard anything positive or negative about an organisation in the past fortnight – subtracting negative responses from positive responses. CharityIndex Rankings highlight the brands with the top average buzz scores between January 1st 2019 and December 31st 2019.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/charity20brands20top20buzz.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Macmillan’s strong showing follows a year where the charity <a href=#>rebranded to attract more diverse volunteers</a>, <a href=#>lobbied parliamentary candidates to introduce cancer-focused health and social care reforms</a>, and saw <a href=#>record numbers of people phoning its helpline for advice</a>.</p><p>Three pet-centric charities were in the top 10: Guide Dogs (6.8) was pushed out of the top three after a slight decline of -0.2 on last year’s performance , while Dogs Trust (6.5) climbed to fifth place and Battersea Dogs & Cats Home fell to ninth (5.6). It’s not too surprising: dogs are popular enough in Britain that owning one can <a href=#>substantially boost your dating prospects</a>.</p><h3>Oxfam starts to win back consumer favour as the biggest buzz improver</h3><p>As with <a href=#>our commercial rankings</a>, the organisation with the “most improved” buzz in 2019 is one which recovered from the effects of a disastrous 2018. Following a year where a high-profile scandal led to severe reputational damage (and around 7,000 lost donors), Oxfam’s score rose a whopping 10.7 points from -13.7 to -3.0 in 2019. The fact that the charity is still on a negative buzz score even after such a large improvement shows it still has some way to go. <a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/inlineimage/2020-02-06/most%20improved%20charities2.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>It’s a similar story (albeit on a smaller scale) with second-placed Save the Children, which saw historic allegations against senior executives in 2018 – and therefore may have seen its score increase by 2.1 points (to 2.0 overall) simply by having a relatively quiet 2019. Other charities in the top 10 improvers all saw incremental score increases of 1.5 points or fewer.</p><p><a href=#><strong>See the full rankings here</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtksLC60q6knqpflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYmyBdX%2BMppicpZmhuaK6jK2mqatdrry2s86vqmabmJa%2FqsDYoqWdnahir7bG2Wapmqabnruov4w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
