The unbeaten English side will take on the equally impressive Italians at Wembley on Sunday to decide the outcome of a competition that has gripped both nations, with 74% of Italians and 66% of the English population interested in the final.</p><h3>The big question, who do fans think is most likely to win?</h3><p>Fans in both countries lean towards their home teams as the most likely to win. Two fifths of English Euro fans (41%) think the Three Lions stand the best chance, compared to 18% of Italians who agree the English are the likely victors.</p><p>Italian fans are more confident, with 53% backing their team as the likely winner, compared to 34% of English fans who consider Italy the favourites. Significant proportions of both English and Italian fans (25% and 28% respectively) are unsure which way the game will go.</p><p>While fans are not entirely confident their side can pull it off, there is little room for disloyalty in either camp. In Italy, 94% of those interested in the Euro 2020 final want Italy to win. In England a similar proportion (91%) are pining for an English victory at long last.</p><p>Desire for the win is strong across both nations even outside of those directly interested in Euro 2020, with some 83% of the general Italian public wanting to see their side win, compared to 72% of the English public.</p><h3>Who is the rest of Europe cheering for?</h3><p>There has been widespread discussion about who fans outside the England and Italy camps will be cheering on, with England’s auld rival the Scots <a href=#>pledging to back the Italians</a>.</p><p>English fans are under no illusions that they will face significant opposition from other nations, with 49% of English Euro 2020 fans thinking other nations’ fans are more likely to cheer the Italians. Only 21% think others are more likely to back the Three Lions.</p><p>Opinion among Italian fans is similar, with 57% thinking they will have the support of other nations’ fans. Only 9% of Italians expect other fans to support the English. Similar proportions of fans in both nations (16% in England and 18% in Italy) doubt other fans care.</p><h3>Will England face extra time, or the dreaded penalty shootout? And who is likely to score?</h3><p>Eight in ten English fans (81%) predict another bout of extra time in the final for England, following their additional 30 minutes against Denmark, with feeling similar among Italian fans (71%). However, twice as many Italians (20%) doubt additional time is likely than English fans (10%).</p><p>Just over half of English fans (58%) think Southgate may face another bout of Euro penalties to decide the final - 25 years after his own missed penalty at Euro ’96. Italians feel similarly, with 63% predicting a dead heat coming down to penalties.</p><p>Despite thinking both extra time and penalties are a likely outcome, fans on both sides are confident their sides will score at least once – but also that the opposition will as well. Some nine in ten England Euro fans (90%) predict an English goal, including 42% who think it’s “very” likely. Over three quarters of Italian fans (77%) are confident the Three Lions will score as well, however only 29% think it’s “very likely” they will concede an English goal.</p><p>On the flip side, nine in ten fans in both countries (91% of English fans and 90% of Italians) think the Italians will score against England, despite Southgate’s squad conceding only once on their route the final.</p><p><strong>See full results <a href=#>here</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLG70a1mmqqknrCtsdJoam9xY2Z6psHRqGRraGJleqe1zZqjZp6Ro8BuvNGem6KbpJ68r7%2BMnqWgpJGjsW7C0magrZmcrg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
