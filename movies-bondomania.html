Dr. No and From Russia with Love, both less than three years old, were being double-billed across the U.S. In the New York area, they jammed 26 theaters, grossed $650,000 for the week. The same crowds, the same large grosses in Boston, Buffalo, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington; at the drive-ins, traffic rivaled the commuting hour.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">What makes the box-office figures the more astonishing is that both films are grossing nearly as much the second time around as the first. Sparking the revival is the success of Goldfinger, the third Bond film, still finishing its first run and heading for a gross that now seems likely to reach $30 million. Nor is Bondomania restricted to the U.S. In England, all three films broke box-office records, and Ian Fleming’s last book, the posthumous Man with the Golden Gun, has already climbed to the top of the bestseller list.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">$100 Million Take. There seems to be no geographical limit to the appeal of sex, violence and snobbery with which Fleming endowed his British secret agent. In Tokyo, the queue for Goldfinger stretches half a mile. In Brazil, where From Russia broke all Rio and Sao Paulo records, one unemployed TV actor had only to change his name to Jaime Bonde to be swamped with offers. In Beirut, where Goldfinger outdrew My Fair Lady, even Goldfinger’s hat-hurling bodyguard, Oddjob, has become a minor hero.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">To date, in hard cover and paperbacks, Bond books have been read by some 30 million, and United Artists estimates that 25 million have seen Bond in reel life. By the time all three current Bond films have been milked dry, the take may top $100 million.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Gadgets Galore. The fact that James Bond has developed into the biggest masscult hero of the decade has given serious pause to such as Britain’s Novelist Kingsley Amis who ranks Fleming “with those demigiants of an earlier day, Jules Verne, Rider Haggard and Conan Doyle”; and to Columbia’s Jacques Barzun, who deplores “the studies by academic critics who have argued over Fleming’s morals and philosophies.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">British Columnist Malcolm Muggeridge is also appalled. While admitting that Bond’s “instant appeal to attractive women, his dash and daring and smartness combined with toughness, make him every inch a hero of our time,” he also notes that “insofar as one can focus on so shadowy and unreal a character, he is utterly despicable: obsequious to his superiors, pretentious in his tastes, callous and brutal in his ways, with strong undertones of sadism, and an unspeakable cad in his relations with women, toward whom sexual appetite represents the only approach.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">What Fleming’s literary critics overlook is that in transferring Bond from fiction to film, and endowing him with all the attributes of Scottish-born Actor Sean Connery, a new twist has been added. Says Chief Scriptwriter Richard Maibaum in the current Esquire: “The common denominator is deadpan spoofing. We know it, the audience knows it, yet they are perfectly willing to alternately believe and disbelieve what is happening on the screen.” To help illusion along, there are not only gadgets galore — Bond’s tricked up Aston-Martin is now a main attraction at the New</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">York World’s Fair—but there is also Pussy Galore, to say nothing of Tilly Masterson and her gilded sister Jill, Tatiana Romanova, and Honeychile Rider.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Bubbles by the Reef. Currently completing the next Bond film, Thunderball, in Nassau and London, Co-Producer Kevin McClory predicts: “In this film, James Bond will be a bigger superman than he has ever been before, bigger than he ought to be.” To make sure the film tops fantasy, $1,500,000 is being sunk into underwater effects alone, including a drowned Vulcan bomber, a two-man sub with mock-up atom bombs (stenciled “Handle like eggs”) tucked under its manta-ray wings, eight SPECTRE henchmen skimming through the water on jet-powered underwater scooters. There will even be underwater sex, although all the cameras will show is bubbles merging by a reef.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Such goings on have had Nassau in an uproar for weeks. The company staged an out-of-season Junkanoo carnival parade for background shots that laid up half the island with hangovers, invited over the whole jet set from Palm Beach for other background shots, and built the “Kiss Kiss Club” on Huntington Hartford’s Paradise Island with such style that one old Nassauvian remarked, “Best damned nightclub on the island. They should have left it there.” But it all left Connery himself on the blah side. “There’s an awful lot of this stuff,” he groused. “Next they’ll be making Son of . . . It’s got so one needs the constitution of a rugby player.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Clobbered Widow. Nor is Connery backward about claiming that he has helped the James Bond image along no end. “You must realize,” he says, “that Ian Fleming’s books began coming out after the war and rationing and all that, and they had all this selectivity of detail of eating and drinking. It was marvelous journalism. But Ian told me it was nothing but padding. You know, vodka must be shaken and not stirred, that kind of razzmatazz. But he did write with a bit of size.” The only thing the Fleming books lacked, in Connery’s view, was a sense of humor. “I discussed it with Ian, and he thought there was humor in them. But Terence Young and I did not. So we injected some.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Director Terence Young agrees, “In a Bond film you aren’t involved in cinema verite or avantgarde. One is involved in colossal fun.” Just what turn the fun can take is indicated by Thunderball’s top-secret opening sequence. There, in rapid order, Bond clobbers a widow (“she” turns out to be a man), strangles him (her) with a fireplace poker, then escapes from the balcony with the aid of a jet-powered backpack, and finally drives off in his Aston-Martin with a blonde.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9ta29laYBwuc6voJ6rXZe8r7DOppinoZFk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
