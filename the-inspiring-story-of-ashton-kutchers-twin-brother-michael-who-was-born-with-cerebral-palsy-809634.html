However, thanks to&nbsp;modern medicine, there are treatments that can improve the existing symptoms and the overall quality of&nbsp;life. Sadly, the number of&nbsp;people with this condition is&nbsp;quite big, and about 2&nbsp;to&nbsp;3&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>children</a> out of&nbsp;every 1,000 have cerebral palsy. But all of&nbsp;them, including Michael Kutcher, actor <a href=# title="Ashton Kutcher" data-link=tag>Ashton Kutcher</a>’s twin brother, prove that nothing can get in&nbsp;your way when you are destined to&nbsp;do&nbsp;great things.</p><p><h2>Michael Kutcher faced the first of&nbsp;many challenges at&nbsp;birth.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/00b/f4b/469059518695fb933b4acaccaf.jpg><p>Michael was the unexpected twin brother of&nbsp;Ashton Kutcher. At&nbsp;the time, their parents had no&nbsp;idea that they were expecting twins. When Michael entered the world, he&nbsp;was 5&nbsp;pounds <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>smaller</a> than his brother, struggling to&nbsp;take his first breath.</p><p>However, with his indomitable instinct to&nbsp;survive and, of&nbsp;course, good medical care, he&nbsp;managed to&nbsp;pull through during his first weeks of&nbsp;life. This, unfortunately, had lasting adverse effects on&nbsp;his health, and in&nbsp;the following years, he&nbsp;battled developmental delays caused by&nbsp;neurological pathologies. And by&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;3, Michael was diagnosed with cerebral palsy.</p><p><h2>Michael never succumbed to&nbsp;the obstacles this condition threw at&nbsp;him and gave his best to&nbsp;rise above&nbsp;it.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a46/aa1/c38d0654c28db38e112da25ca1.jpg><p>Throughout his childhood, Michael had to&nbsp;overcome issues with speech, eyesight, and motor skill development. But he&nbsp;wasn’t alone in&nbsp;it. His family was very <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>supportive</a> during the whole process and encouraged him to&nbsp;always make the best of&nbsp;his circumstances.</p><p>“I&nbsp;think that’s really what gave me&nbsp;the driving power to&nbsp;overcome challenges and obstacles,” Michael <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. “But I&nbsp;learned a&nbsp;lot outside of&nbsp;the family, interacting with different people, and, unfortunately, in&nbsp;society, people with <a href=# title=disabilities data-link=tag>disabilities</a> are looked at&nbsp;as&nbsp;being different. I&nbsp;dealt with those struggles, and&nbsp;I still deal with those struggles.”</p><p><h2>Due to&nbsp;heart failure at&nbsp;age 13, Michael was given a&nbsp;life expectancy of&nbsp;just 3&nbsp;to&nbsp;4&nbsp;weeks.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/267/334/d3f1f758298b3da85604b41573.jpg><p>When Ashton, Michael’s twin, found out that his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>brother’s</a> life was at&nbsp;risk, he&nbsp;wished he&nbsp;could donate his heart to&nbsp;save his life. However, thankfully, they found a&nbsp;donor, and a&nbsp;life-saving heart transplant is&nbsp;how Michael defeated the odds again. This close-to-death experience was, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;way, a&nbsp;wake-up call for him to&nbsp;finally take control of&nbsp;his life. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>graduated</a> in&nbsp;1996 and later earned his Bachelor’s Degree in&nbsp;Business Management and Finance.</p><p>Recently, Michael posted a&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;himself on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Twitter</a>, posing like Superman, and wrote, “I’d like to&nbsp;believe&nbsp;I have an ’S’ on&nbsp;my&nbsp;chest, but&nbsp;I don’t. In&nbsp;fact, I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;scar that kind of&nbsp;looks like an ’S,’ and that’s something that will continue to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;reminder of&nbsp;why I’m here today. At&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the day, we&nbsp;are all superheroes!”</p><p><h2>Even though he&nbsp;fought against the condition fearlessly, he&nbsp;was still ashamed of&nbsp;it.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/97a/230/16fac85f7c9b31b18eecc06b85.jpg><p>For most of&nbsp;his life, Michael tried to&nbsp;hide the disorder that impacts his hearing, speech, vision, and mobility in&nbsp;his right hand. But in&nbsp;2003, his brother, Ashton Kutcher (wanting to&nbsp;do&nbsp;something good for his brother), spoke openly about him and his condition on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>national TV</a>.</p><p>Michael was furious with Ashton. He&nbsp;never wanted to&nbsp;talk publicly about how it&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;live with this condition, and he&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the face of&nbsp;cerebral palsy. However, little did he&nbsp;know that his brother’s openness to&nbsp;the world would change the trajectory of&nbsp;his life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7bc/dea/6f04115e449896927a4232daeb.jpg><p>Willy Sanjuan/Invision/AP/East News</p><p>After his brother’s interview, Michael got a&nbsp;call from a&nbsp;woman who asked him to&nbsp;speak about his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>experience</a> at&nbsp;a&nbsp;gala event. Michael wasn’t sure if&nbsp;he&nbsp;could speak to&nbsp;a&nbsp;room full of&nbsp;strangers about his life, but this woman’s daughter, Bella, who also suffered from cerebral palsy, changed his mind.</p><p>“A&nbsp;sweet little girl with a&nbsp;smile so&nbsp;bright and big,” Michael recalled. “Her cerebral palsy was quite severe and she couldn’t talk. I&nbsp;realized&nbsp;I needed to&nbsp;let go&nbsp;of&nbsp;the shame&nbsp;I felt and be&nbsp;a&nbsp;champion for people like Bella. I&nbsp;was finally ready to&nbsp;tell my&nbsp;story, and&nbsp;I knew because of&nbsp;my&nbsp;twin, I’d have a&nbsp;big reach.”</p><p>Today, Michael is&nbsp;grateful to&nbsp;his brother for shamelessly speaking about him. “Ashton did me&nbsp;the biggest favor he’s ever done because he&nbsp;allowed me&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;myself,” Michael explained.</p><p><h2>Ashton was always there to&nbsp;help and support his brother, and Michael is&nbsp;eternally thankful.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ac7/9c1/3dba895fa2a00ef2423f1b371c.jpg><p>Because of&nbsp;his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>disability</a>, Michael was called all kinds of&nbsp;different names and had difficulty making friends. But Ashton always stood up&nbsp;for his brother, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;wanted everyone to&nbsp;treat him with respect.</p><p>When they were kids and Ashton would’ve been invited for a&nbsp;sleepover, he&nbsp;wouldn’t go&nbsp;if&nbsp;Michael wasn’t allowed to&nbsp;come with him. “Most of&nbsp;the time, they’d say yes, but sometimes they’d say&nbsp;no, and Ashton would say to&nbsp;them, ’Well, then I’m not coming,’” Michael recalled.</p><p>Ashton loves his brother to&nbsp;bits, and once he&nbsp;said to&nbsp;him, “I&nbsp;wish&nbsp;I could take all of&nbsp;this off of&nbsp;you&nbsp;— and take it&nbsp;myself.” He&nbsp;also finds inspiration in&nbsp;Michael. “My&nbsp;brother’s daily actions remind me&nbsp;that life isn’t about running around challenges&nbsp;— it’s about running through them. Mike has a&nbsp;relentless work ethic and deep compassion for others.”</p><p><h2>Michael wouldn’t change his life for anything.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fe0/7fb/0aae2f5f2d9ab64bb9d3ba98ec.jpg><p>Today, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;happily married and is&nbsp;a&nbsp;father of&nbsp;3&nbsp;children. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;spokesperson for The Cerebral Palsy Foundation and an&nbsp;advisor at&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Joshin</a>, an&nbsp;app that helps people find care for a&nbsp;person with disabilities.</p><p>Michael is&nbsp;also proud of&nbsp;the man he&nbsp;has become. “I&nbsp;love who I&nbsp;am. I&nbsp;love the impact I’ve been able to&nbsp;make, and the people I’ve been able to&nbsp;touch. And I&nbsp;wouldn’t have been able to&nbsp;do&nbsp;that If&nbsp;I&nbsp;didn’t have these obstacles, or&nbsp;as&nbsp;I like to&nbsp;call them&nbsp;— an&nbsp;opportunity,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a>.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you know someone with cerebral palsy?
