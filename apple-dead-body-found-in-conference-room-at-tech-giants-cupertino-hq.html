San Jose Mercury News reports that dispatchers received an emergency call at 8:35am and found a man dead.</p><p>According to Techcrunch, the Santa Clara County Fire Department confirmed that it received a report of a Hispanic male who had suffered a head wound, but the fire department was dismissed by the sheriff's and never went onto the Apple campus.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Per a dispatch audio obtained by TMZ, it seems like a female employee was injured and escorted from a building on the Apple campus by the company's own security - but the Sherriff's department did not confirm that anyone was injured in the incident apart from the man who was found dead.</p><p>That TMZ audio also indicates that a body was found in a conference room and a gun may have been found as well. The audio has not been confirmed by the Sheriff's Department and may contain inaccuracies.</p><p>“We are heartbroken by the tragic loss of a young and talented coworker. Our thoughts and deepest sympathies go out to his family and friends, including the many people he worked with here at Apple. We are working to support them however we can in this difficult time,” said an Apple spokesperson, according to Techrunch.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0mirnpuYZK6xvMueZJ2dkZl6o7vDsmSfp6WjsW61zWaaqKaWmr%2BmusKeZKunn6J6osCMrZycoF2ctqK606xknK2gmr%2B1tc2oZKGpX6WAeq7SrWk%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
