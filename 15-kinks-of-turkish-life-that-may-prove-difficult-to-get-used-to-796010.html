But we&nbsp;tend to&nbsp;forget that the lives of&nbsp;the people who live in&nbsp;this country where east meets west are totally different from the rest of&nbsp;the world.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> are going to&nbsp;tell you about everyday Turkish traditions and unspoken rules that are hidden from tourists’ eyes.</p><p><h2>Turkish people never hurry.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dc9/4cb/75d8985c38930f5775a49b1ec5.jpg><p>People in&nbsp;Turkey <a href=#>are used</a> to&nbsp;living in&nbsp;the here and now. They’re not likely to&nbsp;plan things, stick to&nbsp;a&nbsp;schedule, or&nbsp;live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;hectic rhythm. It&nbsp;might even seem that people here have nothing major to&nbsp;do&nbsp;— they drink tea, warm their bones in&nbsp;the sun, and gossip about neighbors. The way they handle business is&nbsp;the same: if&nbsp;they don’t have work to&nbsp;do, it’s okay. No&nbsp;one’s going to&nbsp;make workers do&nbsp;anything they don’t want to&nbsp;or&nbsp;demand the fulfillment of&nbsp;a&nbsp;plan before threatening them with dismissal. On&nbsp;the other side of&nbsp;this zen-like attitude to&nbsp;life is&nbsp;a&nbsp;lack of&nbsp;punctuality. Sometimes it’s quite hard to&nbsp;make an&nbsp;appointment in&nbsp;advance since being late is&nbsp;considered a&nbsp;regular thing here.</p><p><h2>The invasion of&nbsp;men with black headbands</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/158/a58/9069c2556d8961cb3a3e97ace0.jpg><p>Men with shaven heads wearing black headbands and having a&nbsp;bandaged wound on&nbsp;the back of&nbsp;their heads can be&nbsp;seen quite frequently in&nbsp;Istanbul. The first thought that comes to&nbsp;mind is&nbsp;that they’re men performing some sort of&nbsp;secret ritual or&nbsp;that perhaps they’re sick with something. Turns out, these men come to&nbsp;Istanbul to&nbsp;receive hair transplants. Turkish men start to&nbsp;go&nbsp;bald quite early and are very concerned about&nbsp;it. Needless to&nbsp;say, hair transplant clinics prosper in&nbsp;Turkey.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;shoe’s sole instead of&nbsp;a&nbsp;bride’s bouquet</h2></p><p>There are many interesting traditions that take place at&nbsp;Turkish weddings. For example, before the wedding, the bride writes the names of&nbsp;her unmarried friends on&nbsp;the soles of&nbsp;her shoes. The one whose name gets erased first will be&nbsp;the next who gets married. However, the classic throwing back of&nbsp;a&nbsp;bride’s bouquet has been added to&nbsp;this tradition.</p><p><h2>Women prefer getting a&nbsp;cesarean section over natural birth.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/25f/cbd/82a7f05bbd9d7c974e09769283.jpg><p>More than half of&nbsp;Turkish women choose to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;<a href=#>cesarean section</a> even if&nbsp;there’s no&nbsp;medical need for&nbsp;it. This attitude toward <a href=# title=childbirth data-link=tag>childbirth</a> is&nbsp;explained by&nbsp;the way girls here were raised. Turkish women, pampered by&nbsp;her parents since childhood, simply don’t want to&nbsp;endure pain. Recently, Turkish doctors have been insisting on&nbsp;giving birth naturally. The alternative to&nbsp;those who are very afraid to&nbsp;give birth naturally is&nbsp;to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;in&nbsp;water. By&nbsp;the way, Turkish men don’t mind being present during the process of&nbsp;childbirth and some of&nbsp;them even have a&nbsp;photoshoot during&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>Spouses don’t call each other by&nbsp;name.</h2></p><p>If&nbsp;you’re going to&nbsp;marry a&nbsp;Turkish man, keep in&nbsp;mind that not only will you have to&nbsp;say goodbye to&nbsp;things you’re used to&nbsp;but also to&nbsp;your <a href=#>name</a>. In&nbsp;Turkish families, spouses call each other by&nbsp;the words aşkım (my&nbsp;love), güneşim (my&nbsp;sun), canım (my&nbsp;soul), meleğim (my&nbsp;angel) and other eastern epithets&nbsp;— but not their regular name. This is&nbsp;based on&nbsp;the notion that while a&nbsp;person needs an&nbsp;everyday name that can be&nbsp;used by&nbsp;friends and acquaintances, wives and husbands have more intimate relationships and don’t use such formalities.</p><p><h2>Babies are rocked on&nbsp;the legs, not in&nbsp;the arms.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c0c/4a9/2f9ab6585184c608d505443829.jpg><p>It’s no&nbsp;secret that people in&nbsp;this country have a&nbsp;special attitude toward kids. And many people are surprised when they learn that babies are rocked on&nbsp;legs instead of&nbsp;arms here. Instead of&nbsp;carrying a&nbsp;baby in&nbsp;the arms for many hours, the baby is&nbsp;placed on&nbsp;outstretched legs which are then slightly jiggled to&nbsp;rock the kid. This method helps little ones fall asleep quickly and it&nbsp;keeps your arms free to&nbsp;look through a&nbsp;magazine or&nbsp;even eat an&nbsp;apple!</p><p><h2>Funny (and sometimes inappropriate) names of&nbsp;local dishes that don’t surprise anyone</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c3e/8a6/75ea4e5038a6062af512b9c8b8.jpg><p class=adme-img-description>A&nbsp;dessert referred to&nbsp;as&nbsp;“a&nbsp;lady’s navel”</p><p>There are many <a href=#>dishes</a> in&nbsp;Turkey with names that make even Turkish people laugh. If&nbsp;you find delicacies such as&nbsp;“bulletproof cutlets,” “your aunt,” “a&nbsp;boat of&nbsp;pleasure,” “the lips of&nbsp;a&nbsp;beauty,” or&nbsp;“a&nbsp;woman’s hip”&nbsp;— order them without hesitation. They will definitely appease your appetite and lighten your mood.</p><p><h2>Adults don’t celebrate their birthday.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8f0/1dd/fa058d53bebd6f75b9d13b6ed3.jpg><p>It’s only kids’ birthdays that are widely celebrated in&nbsp;Turkey. When people grow&nbsp;up, they stop celebrating this holiday, getting together, and giving or&nbsp;receiving presents. If&nbsp;they want, they’ll have a&nbsp;small celebration within their family by&nbsp;drinking tea and eating cake. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;rule, friends and acquaintances are congratulated by&nbsp;text.</p><p><h2>An&nbsp;obsession with cleanliness</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/71b/406/d0034a5a27a56c999c995d944c.jpg><p>Most Turkish women live only to&nbsp;clean the house and make it&nbsp;sparkle. And no&nbsp;matter how scrupulously you wash the floor and the walls, a&nbsp;true Turkish person will always find faults. A&nbsp;Russian girl who married a&nbsp;Turkish man <a href=#>complained</a> in&nbsp;her blog, “I&nbsp;had been considering myself neat until the moment&nbsp;I started being shown the traces of&nbsp;water drops on&nbsp;a&nbsp;bathroom faucet. When we&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband’s mom’s place for several days, every day starts with cleaning! The paint on&nbsp;the house is&nbsp;flaky, we&nbsp;have breakfast on&nbsp;the floor, and the shower is&nbsp;leaking but the cleanness of&nbsp;the house is&nbsp;the priority!”</p><p><h2>Drinking fountains in&nbsp;memory of&nbsp;deceased relatives</h2></p><p>Few people know that numerous drinking fountains on&nbsp;the Turkish streets are there for a&nbsp;distinct reason&nbsp;— they were installed in&nbsp;honor of&nbsp;deceased relatives, most often, parents. There’s a&nbsp;plate with the name and the surname of&nbsp;the deceased over each fountain. It’s believed that passers-by will drink from such fountains and pray for the souls of&nbsp;this relative which will be&nbsp;beneficial for them in&nbsp;the afterlife.</p><p><h2>Toilets look different.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0f2/7d5/f49150520f8ae991406d462325.jpg><p>A&nbsp;traditional toilet in&nbsp;Turkey is&nbsp;a&nbsp;hole in&nbsp;the floor near a&nbsp;faucet and a&nbsp;jug for washing. Today, bidet toilets, which are equipped with a&nbsp;special hygienic shower, are becoming more and more popular. “On&nbsp;his first visit to&nbsp;Kazan, my&nbsp;Turkish husband couldn’t explain what he&nbsp;was searching for in&nbsp;my&nbsp;toilet,” a&nbsp;girl <a href=#>shared</a> in&nbsp;her blog. “In&nbsp;Turkey, it’s something ordinary: he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;wash himself.”</p><p><h2>Younger people kiss older people’s hands.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c23/9ca/6e705957fc89b22d3a498d016b.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;the rules of&nbsp;etiquette, it’s customary to&nbsp;kiss the hand of&nbsp;an&nbsp;elder person and bring it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the forehead when greeting them in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;express respect for them. They don’t do&nbsp;it&nbsp;with people of&nbsp;the same or&nbsp;younger age&nbsp;— it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;considered humiliating.</p><p><h2>Be&nbsp;prepared to&nbsp;get cheated.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/209/8c9/fc000b55e1880f7763ace8dabe.jpg><p>Just like the skill to&nbsp;bargain, the desire to&nbsp;cheat is&nbsp;in&nbsp;Turkish people’s blood. Souvenir salespeople, taxi drivers, shoe cleaners and other representatives of&nbsp;seemingly harmless professions often turn out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the most skillful cheaters.</p><p><h2>Friendliness that borders on&nbsp;obtrusiveness.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9c0/3ac/6151bd5412af1e8a9e58f9c181.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;the most outstanding characteristics of&nbsp;Turkish people that first causes perplexity and then irritation in&nbsp;foreigners is&nbsp;their obtrusiveness and inability to&nbsp;respect personal space. It’s okay to&nbsp;visit someone’s home without a&nbsp;prior invitation at&nbsp;8&nbsp;am or&nbsp;at&nbsp;8&nbsp;pm. And it’s acceptable to&nbsp;keep sitting there for half a&nbsp;day, gossiping about neighbors. It’s also okay to&nbsp;ask intimate questions about one’s income and personal life as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;touch you and your children. Foreign women show a&nbsp;special interest in&nbsp;local people and their curiosity often overrides good manners. Additionally, they want to&nbsp;teach the newcomers all of&nbsp;the secrets to&nbsp;living the local life.</p><p><h2>No&nbsp;shoes are allowed inside the house.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4ba/285/f34e2b5d73be9500a8d13dcc3c.jpg><p>In&nbsp;Turkey, people don’t go&nbsp;inside a&nbsp;house while wearing shoes. They remove their footwear at&nbsp;the entrance, most often leaving it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the street or&nbsp;at&nbsp;the staircase. Each Turkish household has several pairs of&nbsp;slippers for guests but it’s also okay to&nbsp;bring a&nbsp;pair with you. This action won’t surprise anyone.</p><p>Which of&nbsp;these Turkish traditions did you like?
