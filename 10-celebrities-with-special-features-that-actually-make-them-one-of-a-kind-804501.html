Often, we&nbsp;see photoshopped pictures in&nbsp;magazines and social media making fake expectations about beauty standards. But, it&nbsp;turns out that celebs are normal people just like&nbsp;us. And in&nbsp;the same way that nobody is&nbsp;perfect, one of&nbsp;the most fascinating things in&nbsp;life is&nbsp;that nobody is&nbsp;built the same.</p><p>At&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>, we&nbsp;celebrate all those differences that make&nbsp;us one of&nbsp;a&nbsp;kind, and here are 10&nbsp;celebs with singular features.</p><p><h2>1. Harry Styles&nbsp;— 4&nbsp;nipples</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3f8/acb/03038050f795eebcacfb8b4abc.jpg><p>Apparently, this rare condition is&nbsp;the cherry on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;the extravagant personality of&nbsp;this&nbsp;UK singer. <a href=# title="Harry Styles" data-link=tag>Harry Styles</a> opened up&nbsp;about the rumors of&nbsp;his extra pair of&nbsp;nipples back in&nbsp;2017 during an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a> with Chelsea Handler when he&nbsp;confirmed his condition.</p><p>It&nbsp;can occur that when the body is&nbsp;developing, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>nipple</a> forming cells might accidentally migrate down the chest and appear as&nbsp;small pink bumps with underlying breast tissue. No&nbsp;matter how many nipples Harry Style has, he’s totally golden anyway.</p><p><h2>2. Elizabeth Taylor&nbsp;— violet eyes and an&nbsp;extra row of&nbsp;eyelashes</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/73a/521/d24d8a5ee181d7e62be365bccb.jpg><p>No, there’s no&nbsp;filter in&nbsp;the second pic nor are there fake lashes. <a href=# title="Elizabeth Taylor" data-link=tag>Elizabeth Taylor</a> was born with a&nbsp;double row of&nbsp;eyelashes. And if&nbsp;you look closer, you can find another unique detail, her blue-violet eyes. She was diagnosed at&nbsp;birth with a&nbsp;mutation on&nbsp;the FOXC2 gene that lead to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>distichiasis</a>.</p><p>When hair grows on&nbsp;the wet part of&nbsp;the eyelid, it&nbsp;can occasionally result in&nbsp;having an&nbsp;extra row of&nbsp;eyelashes which is&nbsp;what Taylor has. Sometimes this genetic mutation can be&nbsp;received like a&nbsp;blessing, but in&nbsp;other cases, it&nbsp;can result in&nbsp;irritation of&nbsp;the eye and other inconveniences. Fortunately for Elizabeth, distichiasis was only an&nbsp;extra touch in&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;her natural beauty.</p><p><h2>3. Daniela Ruah&nbsp;— different color eyes</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a83/f59/d39e955ff78c9ba0cf3c4939a5.jpg><p>The American-Portuguese actress and director best known for playing NCIS Special Agent Kensi Blye has an&nbsp;uncommon characteristic that can be&nbsp;spotted easily and that surely makes her stand out. During an&nbsp;interview with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Esquire</a>, she addressed her different colored eyes.</p><p>The birthmark on&nbsp;her eye is&nbsp;called nevus of&nbsp;Ota, which covers the whole white of&nbsp;her right eye. This does not affect her vision, nor did it&nbsp;affect her career. In&nbsp;fact, it’s her trademark that makes her proud.</p><p><h2>4. Winnie Harlow&nbsp;— vitiligo</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7b7/233/00df925a58ac74073359fcd710.jpg><p>The Jamaican-Canadian model Winnie Harlow doesn’t want her condition to&nbsp;define her. It&nbsp;was in&nbsp;2011 when a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>YouTube</a> video was posted in&nbsp;which she addresses that <a href=# title=vitiligo data-link=tag>vitiligo</a> is&nbsp;not the spotlight of&nbsp;her career but a&nbsp;feature to&nbsp;embrace, and people with this condition should not be&nbsp;ashamed of&nbsp;it.</p><p>Vitiligo is&nbsp;a&nbsp;rare autoimmune disorder that affects one in&nbsp;every 100&nbsp;people. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;known that vitiligo is&nbsp;caused due to&nbsp;an&nbsp;alteration in&nbsp;the immune system, in&nbsp;which the cells responsible for pigment making are destroyed, resulting in&nbsp;alterations of&nbsp;the skin. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>As&nbsp;Winnie says</a> “I&nbsp;believe beauty is&nbsp;in&nbsp;the eye of&nbsp;the beholder,” differences are what make&nbsp;us beautiful.</p><p><h2>5. Seal&nbsp;— facial scars</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/900/18c/44739956c8baccd59794691760.jpg><p>Sometimes physical features become our personal marks. Especially when we&nbsp;talk about celebrities and this is&nbsp;the case of&nbsp;the British singer Seal, who has some scars on&nbsp;his face. Over the years, many theories and speculations have come from his fans about how the singer got those scars. However, it&nbsp;turns out that it’s a&nbsp;medical condition.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Discoid Lupus Erythematosus</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;type of&nbsp;lupus that results in&nbsp;a&nbsp;chronic skin condition, which causes sores, inflammation, and, potentially, scars. Most of&nbsp;the time, it&nbsp;affects the face, ears, and scalp. Famous for his music and his marriage to&nbsp;Heidi Klum, Seal continues his career without letting lupus stop him from his success.</p><p><h2>6. Gaten Matarazzo&nbsp;— bone disease</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0b0/029/24d94656cda544dbbd1dcc3b63.jpg><p>Who didn’t fall in&nbsp;love with the adorable role of&nbsp;Gaten Matarazzo in&nbsp;the Netflix series <i>Stranger Things</i>? Whether it&nbsp;was because of&nbsp;his amusing personality or&nbsp;his face, this young actor stole our hearts. But the reason why he&nbsp;is&nbsp;on&nbsp;this list is&nbsp;because of&nbsp;his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Cleidocranial Dysplasia</a>.</p><p>Cleidocranial Dysplasia is&nbsp;a&nbsp;genetic bone disorder. In&nbsp;the case of&nbsp;Gaten, he&nbsp;has supernumerary teeth and an&nbsp;absent collarbone. Gaten Matarazzo shares on&nbsp;his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Instagram</a> profile what it&nbsp;is&nbsp;like to&nbsp;live with this condition. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;always positive and emphasizes the importance of&nbsp;figuring out more about this disease.</p><p><h2>7. Cameron Diaz&nbsp;— rosacea</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6ea/fb7/616c195fb594c8683f5c2fe804.jpg><p>No, it’s not the makeup. <a href=# title="Cameron Diaz" data-link=tag>Cameron Diaz</a> has a&nbsp;rare feature that makes her look naturally blushed. Known as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>rosacea</a>, this skin condition affects the face and it’s characterized by&nbsp;flare-ups and redness on&nbsp;the cheeks, nose, chin, and forehead. This Hollywood star was born with rosacea and even though it&nbsp;can’t be&nbsp;completely cured, it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;controlled.</p><p>In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Parade Magazine</a>, she confessed to&nbsp;having very sensitive skin. Also, the 49-year-old actress has made a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>statement</a> about aging and taking care of&nbsp;oneself by&nbsp;understanding how our body works, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;can take action to&nbsp;help it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the best possible way.</p><p><h2>8. Georgia May Jagger&nbsp;— teeth gap</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c8c/b90/e70a5d5339bc539ec8681cc1f6.jpg><p>Model and daughter of&nbsp;Rolling Stones lead singer Mick Jagger, Georgia May Jagger possesses a&nbsp;signature smile that makes her very unique in&nbsp;the modeling industry. She has a&nbsp;natural teeth gap that is&nbsp;medically known as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Diastema</a>.</p><p>This condition can be&nbsp;caused by&nbsp;many factors, including genetics like the size of&nbsp;the teeth in&nbsp;relation to&nbsp;the jaw bone, or&nbsp;habits like putting pressure on&nbsp;the front teeth when younger that causes the gap between teeth to&nbsp;become wider. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Georgia</a> knows the importance of&nbsp;denying the idea of&nbsp;perfection in&nbsp;modeling by&nbsp;reminding&nbsp;us that everyone is&nbsp;human.</p><p><h2>9. Joaquin Phoenix&nbsp;— cleft lip</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/725/a23/b0b4f852b6ab4ff0d86e633aad.jpg><p>He’s not only known for his impressive acting skills or&nbsp;his important role as&nbsp;an&nbsp;activist for animal rights. He&nbsp;has a&nbsp;singular feature that makes him even more special. Joaquin has a&nbsp;scar on&nbsp;his upper lip that is&nbsp;actually a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>microform cleft</a>. This occurs thanks to&nbsp;a&nbsp;mutation in&nbsp;the BMP4&nbsp;gene.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Clefts</a> are caused due to&nbsp;birth defects when a&nbsp;baby’s lip or&nbsp;mouth do&nbsp;not form properly during pregnancy. The type of&nbsp;cleft that Joaquin has is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the milder versions of&nbsp;a&nbsp;cleft lip, making it&nbsp;more like a&nbsp;birthmark.</p><p><h2>10. Andy Garcia&nbsp;— was born with a&nbsp;Siamese twin</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f62/c95/f0f9f35bfbbe1affe15aa85689.jpg><p>American actor Andy Garcia has an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>unusual story</a> to&nbsp;share. Nowadays if&nbsp;you look at&nbsp;him you won’t notice anything out of&nbsp;the ordinary. But he&nbsp;was born with an&nbsp;undeveloped conjoined twin that was attached to&nbsp;his shoulder. This conjoined twin was the size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;tennis ball and had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;surgically removed at&nbsp;his birth.</p><p>You can’t see the scar, but surely it’s a&nbsp;story Andy will always tell.</p><p>What is&nbsp;the special feature that makes you one of&nbsp;a&nbsp;kind?
