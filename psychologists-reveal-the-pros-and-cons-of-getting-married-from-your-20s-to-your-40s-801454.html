In&nbsp;fact, there isn’t one “ideal” time to&nbsp;say your vows, but each life period can bring advantages and disadvantages depending on&nbsp;your and your partner’s goals, personality, and experience.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> found out what psychologists have to&nbsp;say about the good and the bad of&nbsp;<a href=# title=marrying data-link=tag>marrying</a> earlier or&nbsp;later in&nbsp;life.</p><p><h2>Pro #1: Getting married in&nbsp;your 20s means you grow up&nbsp;together and become stronger.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8bf/34b/e4df635e948e212f780a663035.jpg><p>Waiting for one of&nbsp;you (or&nbsp;both) to&nbsp;finish college and start a&nbsp;<a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a> probably means years and years of&nbsp;separate lives. But going through career changes, <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> issues, and other <a href=#>problems</a> together will give you a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;learn more things about each other. Later it&nbsp;might become a&nbsp;memory you will cherish.</p><p>There is&nbsp;one report that says both <a href=#>women</a> and men, when they are in&nbsp;their mid-twenties, have good odds of&nbsp;a&nbsp;successful marriage with a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;happiness and passion. They have a&nbsp;higher chance to&nbsp;flourish compared to&nbsp;those who wait to&nbsp;get married in&nbsp;their thirties.</p><p><h2>Pro #2: Settling down in&nbsp;your 20s might help you built more wealth.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dfc/9a5/7c76055631835d26833170a298.jpg><p>Postponing your marriage to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;firm hold on&nbsp;your career and start making some good money might actually hold you back from making even more. This is&nbsp;because couples who get married in&nbsp;their twenties can accumulate more <a href=#>money</a>. Both the expenses and incomes get shared, which will result in&nbsp;a&nbsp;balance.</p><p>This can help both of&nbsp;you reach your financial and housing goals faster.</p><p><h2>Pro #3: In&nbsp;your 20s you have time for more kids.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b6c/289/4a8d975323b6b160d437d93862.jpg><p>Not only you will have time for more than one child but you will have more <a href=#>energy</a> to&nbsp;help them grow and enjoy your time together. Plus, you’ll have more time to&nbsp;enjoy yourself as&nbsp;a&nbsp;grandparent. Plus <a href=#>peak</a> of&nbsp;<a href=# title=fertility data-link=tag>fertility</a> years for women is&nbsp;between the late teen years to&nbsp;late 20s.</p><p>After the age of&nbsp;30, the ability to&nbsp;conceive will start to&nbsp;decline and start to&nbsp;lower faster after you reach 35&nbsp;years.</p><p><h2>Pro #4: In&nbsp;your late 20s you are more aware of&nbsp;yourself as&nbsp;a&nbsp;person.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2d1/17c/72bafc5b2b8af60080fd63ee82.jpg><p>28&nbsp;might just be&nbsp;the number you want to&nbsp;consider for settling down. A&nbsp;family and marriage therapist says that at&nbsp;28&nbsp;we tend to&nbsp;have <a href=#>strong</a> self-awareness as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;confidence in&nbsp;our choice of&nbsp;finding a&nbsp;partner. It&nbsp;might mean we&nbsp;had just the right amount of&nbsp;time to&nbsp;finish school, start a&nbsp;career, and enough time to&nbsp;explore and learn from previous mistakes in&nbsp;past relationships.</p><p><h2>Pro #5: In&nbsp;your 30s you have a&nbsp;better sense of&nbsp;identity.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7d7/c2f/b0d39857f280b377e71d469c47.jpg><p>We&nbsp;usually learn more about ourselves when we&nbsp;are in&nbsp;our 20s. It’s the time when you grow as&nbsp;a&nbsp;person. Waiting to&nbsp;get <a href=#>married</a> until your 30s might be&nbsp;better because you could have a&nbsp;higher sense of&nbsp;self. Actually more and more people decide to&nbsp;experience life before marriage, not waiting to&nbsp;explore life with their partner. This could make you more confident, a&nbsp;better communicator, and a&nbsp;stronger individual.</p><p><h2>Pro #6: After 30&nbsp;means a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;build your career.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/28b/ae4/f35f7c5c848c11c9fb22b28644.jpg><p>If&nbsp;your goal is&nbsp;focused on&nbsp;education, career, and earning more money before getting married, then the 30s is&nbsp;the best year for you to&nbsp;settle down with your partner. This is&nbsp;because studying and working use a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;your energy and time, and you <a href=#>might</a> not be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;give your partner the attention he&nbsp;needs and the same goes for him.</p><p><h2>Con #1: In&nbsp;your 20s it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;difficult to&nbsp;miss the red flags in&nbsp;your relationship.</h2></p><p>When it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;relationships, <a href=#>young</a> means inexperienced, and you might miss some lows and highs in&nbsp;yours. You might not be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;see the signs that actually show that you are not compatible with your partner. This is&nbsp;mostly because you are focused more on&nbsp;the good and it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;more difficult to&nbsp;see the bad.</p><p>Your perspective could become clouded and you won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;take any significant steps to&nbsp;change and/or justify your actions to&nbsp;what is&nbsp;considered a&nbsp;healthy relationship.</p><p><h2>Con #2: Your brain might not be&nbsp;developed in&nbsp;your early 20s.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f89/8d9/be0352500fa9f8fce3e189de48.jpg><p>If&nbsp;we&nbsp;look from a&nbsp;neurological standpoint, then it’s <a href=#>better</a> to&nbsp;get married after your brain is&nbsp;fully developed, which <a href=#>means</a> after you turn 25&nbsp;years old. So, even if&nbsp;you are in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship that started in&nbsp;high school or&nbsp;your early 20s, you may want to&nbsp;wait and see how you 2&nbsp;can handle a&nbsp;long-distance relationship, getting jobs, and college.</p><p><h2>Con #3: Getting married before 30&nbsp;might result in&nbsp;divorce.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e94/0c0/f4843856e493a51eea100b5053.jpg><p>60% of&nbsp;<a href=#>marriages</a> that usually start between 20&nbsp;to&nbsp;25&nbsp;years of&nbsp;age might end up&nbsp;in&nbsp;divorce. Most of&nbsp;the reasons for this happening are due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;lack of&nbsp;commitment, equality in&nbsp;the relationship, and marriage preparations, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;unrealistic expectations and too much arguing.</p><p><h2>Con #4: Attraction might not last long when you get married in&nbsp;your 20s.</h2></p><p>The attraction that many couples had toward one another earlier in&nbsp;life, might start to&nbsp;fade in&nbsp;their late 20s or&nbsp;30s. This means that keeping the <a href=# title=communication data-link=tag>communication</a> alive and having a&nbsp;good time in&nbsp;the bedroom can become a&nbsp;challenge. This is&nbsp;an&nbsp;even more difficult <a href=#>disadvantage</a> when only one of&nbsp;you loses interest because it&nbsp;can impact the other one badly.</p><p><h2>Con #5: Living as&nbsp;a&nbsp;single person longer might make it&nbsp;more difficult to&nbsp;live with someone else later.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/64d/6be/9293c05eae8f8fcdf4380cb21d.jpg><p>As&nbsp;single people, we&nbsp;tend to&nbsp;enjoy the freedom to&nbsp;experiment and experience many different relationships before we&nbsp;commit to&nbsp;only one and then get married. This <a href=#>means</a> that we&nbsp;had a&nbsp;lot more time to&nbsp;develop our own priorities and preferences. At&nbsp;first, blending mutual goals and ideas might seem pretty easy.</p><p>However, for a&nbsp;person who’s lived most of&nbsp;their life single, things could quickly become more real and complicated. This is&nbsp;because we&nbsp;need to&nbsp;make room for our partners’ priorities too and to&nbsp;even compromise our own, which can threaten the future of&nbsp;the marriage.</p><p><h2>Con #6: In&nbsp;your 30s you might not be&nbsp;that comfortable sharing your finances.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8fa/57d/1d617c52a1b0d310dc507c66da.jpg><p>When you are single, you are only thinking of&nbsp;yourself, your needs, and your schedule. You carefully organize your time and make plans in&nbsp;advance that you can follow <a href=#>through with</a>. The same goes for saving money. Many couples who were used to&nbsp;budgeting their money on&nbsp;their own fight over saving money and also on&nbsp;what, when, and where to&nbsp;spend&nbsp;it.</p><p>When do&nbsp;you plan to&nbsp;get married and why?
