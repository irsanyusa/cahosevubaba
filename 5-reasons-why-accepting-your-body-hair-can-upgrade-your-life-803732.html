In&nbsp;all of&nbsp;this, they sometimes don’t notice how much mental and physical effort is&nbsp;put into following these demanding norms.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> decided to&nbsp;take another perspective on&nbsp;these established standards. Together with you, we&nbsp;want to&nbsp;discuss why it’s totally normal to&nbsp;forget about <a href=# title="hair removal" data-link=tag>hair removal</a> for a&nbsp;short time. And as&nbsp;it&nbsp;turns out, it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;beneficial to&nbsp;your body and make you feel better about yourself.</p><p><h2>1. Others will feel how attractive you are.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/db1/1f3/cb1f0f570fbb4ee81462646e82.jpg><p><strong>Sweat glands help&nbsp;us to&nbsp;release our </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>pheromones</strong></a><strong>, while the hair on&nbsp;our body helps&nbsp;us spread our odor.</strong> Research <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>proves</a> that our natural body scent plays an&nbsp;important role in&nbsp;the attraction of&nbsp;people around&nbsp;us. In&nbsp;fact, armpit hair helps to&nbsp;trap this musk, making the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>effect</a> of&nbsp;pheromones even stronger.</p><p><h2>2. You can free yourself from pain.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/689/7ba/97f67a505e8353280cbe727d52.jpg><p>Hair removal procedures like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>shaving</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>waxing</strong></a><strong>, or&nbsp;</strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>sugaring</strong></a><strong> can bring <a href=# title=pain data-link=tag>pain</a>, irritation, and red bumps, especially to&nbsp;those who have sensitive skin.</strong> But many women still proceed to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this, convincing themselves that this is&nbsp;normal and acceptable, no&nbsp;matter how much physical discomfort they feel from this. Sometimes, it’s necessary to&nbsp;stop for a&nbsp;moment and let your body rest for the sake of&nbsp;your own <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wellness</a> and health.</p><ul><li>I&nbsp;gradually stopped. I&nbsp;have very sensitive skin, and for years&nbsp;I tried different hair removal methods and dealt with the ingrown hairs, rashes, and cystic-type lumps that cropped up&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result. Armpits were particularly bad, so&nbsp;I stopped shaving them. A&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;years ago&nbsp;I was about to&nbsp;wax my&nbsp;legs and&nbsp;I thought “Who am&nbsp;I doing this for?” And I&nbsp;could not for the life of&nbsp;me&nbsp;think of&nbsp;a&nbsp;good answer to&nbsp;that question. Still can’t. Still hairy.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Sorxhasmyname&nbsp;/ reddit</a></li><li>My&nbsp;armpits were always super irritated after shaving, so&nbsp;I&nbsp;quit. I&nbsp;still shave my&nbsp;lower legs because the hair there is&nbsp;very dark and thick but it’s barely noticeable on&nbsp;my&nbsp;thighs, so&nbsp;I leave that.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>© -breadstick-&nbsp;/ reddit</a></li></ul><p><h2>3.

It&nbsp;also plays a&nbsp;role in&nbsp;regulating your body <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>temperature</a>. <strong>Air gets trapped between the hair and the skin, creating a&nbsp;layer that helps to&nbsp;insulate the skin against heat loss.</strong></p><p><h2>4.

We&nbsp;might constantly criticize <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>our</a> bodies and feel pressured to&nbsp;fit in&nbsp;the standards of&nbsp;beauty and behavior that the world around&nbsp;us follows. <strong>Rethinking your relationship with your body hair can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;solid step in&nbsp;creating a&nbsp;positive image of&nbsp;yourself and feeling free about living life the way you want.</strong></p><ul><li>I&nbsp;really feel so&nbsp;great. I&nbsp;love doing my&nbsp;makeup and having a&nbsp;cute feminine outfit on&nbsp;with my&nbsp;leg and armpit hair. I&nbsp;feel more authentically beautiful and so&nbsp;deeply confident and sexy.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;iffle&nbsp;/ reddit</a></li><li>When I&nbsp;was in&nbsp;high school&nbsp;I shaved my&nbsp;legs, underarms, and private parts regularly because&nbsp;I was very embarrassed about my&nbsp;hair. First, I&nbsp;stopped doing it&nbsp;in&nbsp;winter because&nbsp;I had no&nbsp;one that would see my&nbsp;hair for a&nbsp;while, and after the prickly stage, I&nbsp;love how it&nbsp;all looked! It&nbsp;made me&nbsp;love my&nbsp;natural body even more.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;ohlookitsdd&nbsp;/ reddit</a></li></ul><p><h2>5.

They won’t force you to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>change</a> yourself for them and won’t make you feel uncomfortable about your body. <strong>Instead, such people can help you feel accepted and empowered.</strong></p><ul><li>I&nbsp;hate getting razor burn or&nbsp;itchy skin after shaving so&nbsp;I just stopped. My&nbsp;boyfriend doesn’t care and living in&nbsp;the Bay Area in&nbsp;California, it’s not that big of&nbsp;a&nbsp;deal. I&nbsp;see a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;girls with hairy armpits like&nbsp;me. Feeling the breeze through your leg hair is&nbsp;surprisingly nice, compared to&nbsp;the momentary smoothness from shaving.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Hcat23&nbsp;/ reddit</a></li><li>I’m half-Arabian in&nbsp;a&nbsp;European country and I’ve always noticed that the hair on&nbsp;my&nbsp;body is&nbsp;much darker and more visible. I&nbsp;was okay with it&nbsp;until a&nbsp;girl in&nbsp;my&nbsp;class laughed at&nbsp;me&nbsp;when&nbsp;I was 12. I&nbsp;became really really ashamed of&nbsp;my&nbsp;body hair and hid it&nbsp;for 3&nbsp;years during summer by&nbsp;only wearing long shirts and pants. From the moment&nbsp;I was allowed to&nbsp;shave, I&nbsp;removed basically everything below my&nbsp;nose since then, a&nbsp;few times a&nbsp;week. But it&nbsp;all changed when&nbsp;I found a&nbsp;boyfriend. I&nbsp;was still very insecure about my&nbsp;body hair when he&nbsp;said, “Body hair is&nbsp;natural. I&nbsp;like it&nbsp;being visible. It&nbsp;reminds me&nbsp;that I&nbsp;am not sleeping with a&nbsp;child. I&nbsp;find this more attractive than no&nbsp;visible body hair at&nbsp;all.” He&nbsp;helped me&nbsp;remember that we’re all allowed to&nbsp;feel comfortable with ourselves, especially if&nbsp;it’s something so&nbsp;natural.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Naevok&nbsp;/ reddit</a></li></ul><p><h2>6.

Embracing your body hair can free you from these routines.<strong> Instead, you can work on&nbsp;your future by&nbsp;</strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>investing</strong></a><strong> this time and money in&nbsp;your personal growth or&nbsp;giving small </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>presents</strong></a><strong> to&nbsp;yourself.</strong> Later&nbsp;on, this will pay you back in&nbsp;the form of&nbsp;better opportunities and greater well-being.</p><ul><li>I&nbsp;stopped shaving my&nbsp;arms. I&nbsp;used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;really embarrassed because I’m so&nbsp;hairy and it’s so&nbsp;dark. I&nbsp;thought something was wrong with&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;save money on&nbsp;shaving stuff and don’t take as&nbsp;long in&nbsp;the shower. It’s funny too because&nbsp;I was recently considering starting again. And then&nbsp;I was at&nbsp;the hospital the other night and a&nbsp;nurse had to&nbsp;rip my&nbsp;IV tape off. I&nbsp;made a&nbsp;joke that it&nbsp;was like free waxing and she commented, “Not that you need&nbsp;it.” It&nbsp;gave me&nbsp;a&nbsp;boost of&nbsp;confidence. My&nbsp;arms are normal human arms and&nbsp;I don’t have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;anything to&nbsp;them that&nbsp;I don’t want&nbsp;to.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;tomorrowistomato&nbsp;/ reddit</a></li></ul><p><h2>Bonus: It&nbsp;can help you to&nbsp;overcome issues from the past.</h2></p><p>Even now, female body hair is&nbsp;considered inappropriate in&nbsp;different <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cultures</a>. From a&nbsp;very young age, some <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>girls</a> can be&nbsp;forced to&nbsp;fit the standards and get rid of&nbsp;them as&nbsp;quickly as&nbsp;possible. This can result in&nbsp;anxiety and lower their self-esteem. <strong>Recognizing and accepting your body hair can be&nbsp;the first step to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;your fears and feel mentally stronger.</strong></p><ul><li>I&nbsp;only ever did it&nbsp;because when&nbsp;I was a&nbsp;teen&nbsp;I was bullied a&nbsp;lot about my&nbsp;appearance and had low self-esteem. If&nbsp;there was anything&nbsp;I could do&nbsp;to&nbsp;blend&nbsp;in, I&nbsp;did&nbsp;it. Once I&nbsp;got a&nbsp;little older and stopped caring, I&nbsp;decided one day to&nbsp;stop shaving and see what happened. Nothing happened.
