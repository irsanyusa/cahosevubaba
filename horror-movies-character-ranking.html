Paramount Pictures’ “Smile” and 20th Century Studios’ “Barbarian” also won their respective opening weekends, beating <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>expectations</a> and highlighting audiences’ thirst for thrills and chills at the movies this time of year.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">New Morning Consult data shows that Gen Z adults are driving Hollywood’s spooky season, with nearly a third (32%) saying they’ve seen a horror movie in theaters in the last month and two-thirds reporting they’ve gone to one in the last 12 months.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>The success of original horror&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Hollywood studios often struggle to create successful new action movie franchises, resorting to milking existing intellectual property until there’s little left for audiences to enjoy. That hasn’t been the case in the horror genre, as several of its recent box office hits, including “Barbarian,” “Smile” and others, were original stories.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Even the indie grindhouse horror film “Terrifier 2” has gotten a lot of traction this month, <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>grossing</a> over $1 million against its micro-budget of $250,000 and little marketing. The film has gone viral online thanks to stories of moviegoers vomiting and passing out. “Smile,” too, became a trending topic when Paramount placed <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>creepy, smiling actors</a> behind the home plate of several Major League Baseball games. Word-of-mouth and social media have helped the film earn more than $166 million at the global box office to date.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Horror fans have more to look forward to: Lionsgate’s exorcism tale “Prey for the Devil” comes out this Friday, Amazon Studios’ “Nanny” premieres on the streaming service next month and Universal Pictures’ “M3GAN,” whose titular, highly memeable doll is already <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>going viral</a> on social media, is slated for release in January. Morning Consult data shows that nearly a quarter of U.S. adults (24%) are interested in seeing “M3GAN.”</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large"><i>The Oct. 18, 2022, survey was conducted among a representative sample of 2,210 U.S. adults, with an unweighted margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZLavv9Oapa1lmaPBpriOoaarqp%2Bneq671aKcrGWTna6zrcKtnKtlopa7rLXNoA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
