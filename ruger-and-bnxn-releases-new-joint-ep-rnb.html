It’s like a relay race," BNXN said on the 7-track project which serves as a celebration of the truce between both artists after nearly 2 years of rift.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>BNXN</strong> described the EP as a collaborative effort he's very proud of. BNXN also suggests that there's more to come from the duo as he points attention to the last track on the EP.</p><p>"...I am beyond proud of this project. It’s why the last song we said "Not Done," because hopefully we’re not done."</p><p>Speaking on the project, <strong>Ruger</strong> stated that he enjoyed working with <strong>BNXN</strong> because they are two artists who make music beyond the thematic depth. He further stated that the depth of their lyrics is something that needs to be appreciated by Nigerian listeners because it's hugely appreciated abroad.</p><p>"You know most Afrobeats artists, they’re always about gyration, enjoyment - let’s make songs people will party to, let’s talk about enjoyment and money and that. We’re talking about everything! Go back to our projects, we talk about everything, we talk about relationships. Most artists in Naija don’t talk about relationships like that, they talk about ‘your body’s banging, you’re fine, you’re this’ but we’re saying the deeper things. As much as the whole world is appreciating that part, I think Nigerians have to actually appreciate that about us, because when we go outside the country that’s what they love about us. "That guy is speaking to me!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6mrKyhk2S%2FtrPEq2SappRir6%2FEzWapnqSVlsCmv4ynnLBlmqS2r8CMnqdmqp6XfHeF2bNvo6Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
