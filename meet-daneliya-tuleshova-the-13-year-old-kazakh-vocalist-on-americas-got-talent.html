She speaks both Russian and English. She lives with her parents and her two younger siblings Timur and Amelie. Timur is pursuing judo and Amelie is training in ballet. They both look up to their older sister immensely and are so proud of her for all of the amazing things she has accomplished at such a young age.

But after suffering from a bad fall and being injured at the age of 4, she was unable to return to the sport. This contributed to her singing more and taking more vocal lessons as she recovered.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Ballroom Dancing Was One Of Daneliya Tuleshova’s First Passions</h3><p>When she was just 6 years old, Daneliya began taking dance lessons. She got her start competing in local dance competitions and also began taking acting lessons. More vocal lessons soon followed and she entered a competition called “New Wave Kids” where she made it to the finals. After her success at this international contest, she began to focus more on singing and took private voice lessons for the first time. All the while, she continued to compete at dance competitions. Wow, she really has been given so many talents! She said in an interview with KTLA 5 that she started singing when she was born but started singing professionally when she was 10.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/6peP02kvln/</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>She Won ‘The Voice Kids Ukraine’</h3><p>Daneliya fans already know that she won the Ukrainian version of The Voice Kids in 2017. Her audition singing Demi Lovato’s song “Stone Cold” immediately captured all of the coaches’ attention. She gained even more fans and exposure after that. She was the first non-Ukrainian to win the show.&nbsp;Daneliya also competed in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest of 2018 and finished in sixth place.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Danelyia Competed on ‘The World’s Best’</h3><p>She competed on&nbsp;The World’s Best and auditioned with a rendition of&nbsp;Andra Day’s&nbsp;“Rise Up.” Her performance was so good she even made judge&nbsp;Drew Barrymore&nbsp;cry.

His extensive vocal range could never be matched. But, he shockingly withdrew during the Championship Round, which was the semi-final round. This is because he wanted to give younger performers like Danelyia a chance to really showcase their young talents. The pair have always maintained a friendship and have both gone on to become global superstars. Dimash even competed on The Masked Singer in China.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The TNT Boys Said Danelyia Was Their Biggest Competition On ‘The World’s Best’</h3><p>Filipino boyband TNT Boys gained prominence on The World’s Best and made it all the way to the Championship Round.

She spent a lot of time in California prior to her ‘AGT’ audition. One of the things she marveled at in America was yellow school buses. And another thing she is also keen on are American pharmacies because they have “everything for life.” It was her dream to make slime with Elmers Glue and she could not believe that they sold it at American pharmacies. What better way to celebrate her love for America than being on America’s Got Talent season 15?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>RELATED: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>GLOBAL STAR DIMASH KUDAIBERGEN ELIMINATED ON ‘MASKED SINGER’ CHINA</a></strong></p><p>We don’t exactly know if Daneliya Tuleshova will win America’s Got Talent but we wish her to make it all the way to the end.
