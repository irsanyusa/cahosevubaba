She’s appeared in several movies and TV shows over the years, both as herself and as fictional characters.</strong></p><p>One role of hers you might have forgotten about is as the giant Brumhilda in the movie Ella Enchanted. You’d be forgiven for forgetting that movie entirely, considering it wasn’t exactly a masterpiece. Still, watching Klum’s scenes makes for a fun bit of nostalgia.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-heidi-klum-played-a-giant-in-ella-enchanted>Heidi Klum Played a Giant in ‘Ella Enchanted’</h2><p>In case you don’t know, Ella Enchanted was a 2004 movie starring Anne Hathaway. It was based on a beloved 1997 fantasy book by Gail Carson Levine, about a girl who does whatever she’s told. Don’t expect a faithful adaptation from the film, though. It’s a lot sillier than its source material.</p><p>Silly how, you might ask? Well, at one point in the story, Ella and Prince Char (Hugh Dancy) crash a wedding for giants. One of those giants is none other than Heidi Klum, who was well-known as a Victoria’s Secret Angel when the movie came out.</p><p>Klum’s character, Brumhilda, gets her flirt on with an elf named Slannen (Aidan McArdle). She criticizes the Grimm brothers for making giants out to be “big, ugly, and mean.” It should come as no surprise that the model didn’t win any acting awards for her role.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>However, the CGI to make her look bigger than Slannen is so terrible, and the movie itself is so goofy, that criticizing Klum’s performance would be pretty unfair. Unlike the green screen work, at least she tried to be believable.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>HEIDI KLUM ACCIDENTALLY FLASHES THE ‘AMERICA’S GOT TALENT’ LIVE AUDIENCE</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-listen-to-klum-singing-don-t-go-breaking-my-heart>Listen to Klum Singing ‘Don’t Go Breaking My Heart’</h3><p>At the end of the movie (spoiler alert) Ella and Char get married, and there’s a big group musical number at the wedding to <a href=#>“Don’t Go Breaking My Heart”</a> by Elton John and Kiki Dee. Brumhilda and Slannen are in attendance, and Klum actually sings!</p><p>And you know what? She’s not half bad. She probably wouldn’t earn the Golden Buzzer, but it doesn’t make us want to cover our ears. Klum actually showed off her voice again over a decade later, <a href=#>performing “Santa Baby”</a> with America’s Got Talent contestant Sal Valentinetti.</p><p>Klum went for a breathier style for that performance, but it worked for her. She may not be the best actress or singer in the world, but you have to give her credit for having fun with her performances. That’s always more enjoyable to watch than someone who looks like they don’t want to be there.</p><p>Some of Klum’s other acting credits include Sex and the City, Desperate Housewives, and Parks and Recreation. She’s also done voices in projects like Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil and Arctic Dogs. She also appeared in Sia’s “Fire Meet Gasoline” video with Pedro Pascal.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GettyImages-1210695433.jpg alt="Where to Watch John Legend’s Tony Awards Performance with Breakout Broadway Stars" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>heidi klum</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570Z6knqWSmr9uwMeaq2asmaKybrTEopuiZZuhwq55z6WYsp2UYq5us8iapa1lmaN6tbTEZmlpaGRitarAjJ6jpZldmruktMCnq56cXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
