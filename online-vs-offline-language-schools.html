When you’re finally ready to commit to language classes, this decision is perhaps the hardest. Let’s talk about why.</p><p>In our increasingly globalized world, learning a new language is smart. It’ll boost your career, help you stand out in today’s competitive job market and even sharpen your brain. Plus, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">learning a new language</a> helps you connect with other cultures and learn from other people.</p><p>We know there are plenty of ways <a href=#>to learn a new language</a>. To narrow down your choices, you should first decide whether to go online or offline. But, what are the pros and cons of each? Which <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">online language courses</a> are the best? What aspects of the classes should you consider when choosing? In this article, we’ll break down everything about online vs offline language schools and compare class options to help you decide!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Online-vs-offline-language-schools>Online vs. offline language schools</h2><p>Recent years have ushered in a new era of learning: online learning platforms. Thanks to technological progress, we can now pick up new skills from wherever we are. Additionally, our COVID-19 years showed us that e-learning can indeed be an effective way to adapt to changing circumstances when it comes to schooling. With our at-home workspaces becoming a permanent fixture in our homes, the question of online vs offline language schools is more of a reality than ever.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-online-language-schools>Online language schools</h3><p>The best part about online study is that most online language schools give students the ability to choose classes with a customized fit for their schedule, goals and learning style. We can choose between private or group lessons, morning or afternoon classes and even ask the instructor to focus on a particular accent or skill. In short, online language schools offer us:</p><ul><li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Since teachers are spread across different time zones, students have high scheduling flexibility. You can schedule a class at nearly any time slot in a 24-hour period. Plus, as long as you’ve got a working device and internet connection, you can join in from anywhere. Study from home, at the library, on your commute or take your class from a local café.<br></li><li><strong>Personalized classes:</strong> Online schools usually do a better job of offering private or small-group lessons. These smaller online learning environments give you enough time to ask questions and get personalized feedback. This helps you make progress faster.<br></li><li><strong>Learning from native speakers:</strong> One of the best ways to nail correct grammar, pronunciation and vocabulary is to learn from a native speaker. Online language schools give you the chance to work with native-speaking teachers no matter where you live in the world. If your goal is to learn a particular accent, for example, online is your best option.<br></li><li><strong>Custom choices: </strong>With so many e-learning options out there, you can choose the school and classroom setting that best fit your learning style and goals.<br></li><li><strong>Cost-effectiveness: </strong>Because online classes do not require the expense of running a brick-and-mortar school campus, they are often more affordable than in-person learning.</li></ul><p>Though online is fantastic, there are some obstacles we should consider:</p><ul><li><strong>Technical issues: </strong>Technology can fail. So, when you’re learning online, you might need to reschedule a lesson or deal with annoying technical difficulties like a dropped WiFi signal or a time lag in the audio.<br></li><li><strong>Distractions:</strong> E-learning can lead to many distractions (social media addicts, beware). Discipline is key!<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Lack of in-person interaction:</strong> Online learning eliminates the physical in-person interaction with teachers and classmates. This might make it harder to pick up on cultural cues or even impact your motivation as a student.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-offline-language-schools>Offline language schools</h3><p>Let’s dive into the more traditional way of learning: in-person schooling. While e-learning removes most time and spatial constraints, offline lessons are tied to a specific location and regular schedule. Consistency can be difficult if you have a busy life. However, there are still some perks to conventional classes:</p><ul><li><strong>Fewer distractions: </strong>Taking our studies to an in-person classroom can help us avoid many distractions. Classrooms are set up for teaching and studying, so you’re less likely to get sidetracked.<br></li><li><strong>Human interaction:</strong> Some students prefer face-to-face communication with their teachers because it fosters a more personal and interactive learning environment. Plus, attending in-person classes with other students helps you make friends with people who are just as passionate about the new language as you are. This builds a sense of community that can keep you motivated.<br></li></ul><p>And the cons?</p><ul><li><strong>Lack of flexibility:</strong> Offline learning is tied to a place and time. You’ll have to stick to a set schedule to keep progressing. If you have a hectic life, this might lead to dropping out and not achieving your goals.<br></li><li><strong>Less affordable:</strong> In-person language classes tend to be more expensive than online lessons. Private schools need to spend money to maintain a clean and safe learning environment. Those expenses are funded by student tuition. The fees can range from affordable to sky-high depending on how nice the school campus is.<br></li><li><strong>Less convenient:</strong> You’ll need to travel to the class location. Your commute can be a hassle and add to your costs. If you are learning on a budget, consider the price of public transportation or gas as part of your spending.<br></li><li><strong>Large groups: </strong>Offline schools often can get crowded. A local community college lecture hall can often seat 100 students or more. This might slow down your learning since students have different learning paces. Large class sizes mean the teacher has to run the class at an average speed, often leaving the fastest and slowest learners to fend for themselves.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Lingoda-vs-Goethe-Institut>Lingoda vs Goethe-Institut</h2><p>Next up: Lingoda vs Goethe-Institut. This is an online vs offline school showdown and will focus on learning German! Let’s take a look at both of these options:</p><ul><li><strong>Lingoda</strong> is an online platform that connects you with certified, native-level teachers from around the world. Since Lingoda classes are available 24/7, you can always find a class that fits your schedule. With a variety of courses – including private and group lessons with up to 5 classmates – it’s perfect for anyone starting out with a new language or looking to polish their skills. The best part? Lingoda is always innovating to help their students boost their confidence quickly and helps them speak from day 1!&nbsp; If you want to learn at a fixed schedule with the same classmates every week, check their new <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lingoda Teams</a> program!<br></li></ul><p><h2 class=headline>Start with Lingoda today</h2></p><ul readability=0.5><li readability=4>The <strong>Goethe-Institut</strong> is one of Germany’s most popular on-site language schools, with branches in almost 100 countries. Their mission is to promote the German language, foster cultural exchange and prepare learners for everyday life and work in German-speaking countries.<p>At the institute, you can progress from a beginner to a fluent German speaker with the help of their practice-based teaching method. They offer both private and group lessons, with groups of up to 16 students. A bonus? They also have an online platform to support in-person learning and some online courses.<br></p></li></ul><p>Both schools offer certificates.</p><p><strong>Which is better?</strong></p><p>Both options are great for learning German and it boils down to how you want to learn: . Lingoda is great for those with busy lives, offering full flexibility no matter where you are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">(Lingoda reviews</a> won’t let us exaggerate the truth!). On the other hand, the Goethe-Institut is ideal for intensive on-site learning – if there’s a location near you.</p><p>Another key difference? Lingoda offers courses in several languages, while the Goethe-Institut specializes solely in German.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Rosetta-Stone-vs-Babbel->Rosetta Stone vs. Babbel&nbsp;</h2><p>Okay, we’ve covered online vs. offline language schools’ pros and cons. Now, let’s compare some of the options available out there. Let’s find the one that’s right for you. First up: Rosetta Stone vs Babbel. Both are online platforms, so they offer the flexibility many of us need.</p><p>Here’s a quick rundown of what each one brings to the table:</p><ul><li><strong>Rosetta Stone</strong> focuses on immersion, teaching through real-world scenarios and interactive activities. They offer fixed, bite-sized lessons and live coaching with native speakers to help fine-tune your skills. These sessions are capped at six learners but can also be private. Just note that they are designed to support what you’ve already learned through the software, not to start you from scratch.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Babbel </strong>has two versions: Babbel App and Babbel Live. The app offers short pre-recorded lessons that let you learn at your own pace, with materials like podcasts and games to practice everyday language. Babbel Live, on the other hand, provides private and group classes with up to six students, and you can take as many courses as you want on topics of your choice. It also gives you access to the app.</li></ul><p>Both options offer certificates.</p><p><strong>Which is better?</strong></p><p><strong></strong>If you’re aiming to get to a basic conversational level quickly, Rosetta Stone might be your best bet. The focus on immersion and vocabulary repetition is great for fast learning. However, if you aim for fluency and get bored easily with repetition, we recommend Babbel Live. It builds your skills gradually and their live classes offer a more comprehensive approach.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Mondly-vs.-Babbel>Mondly vs. Babbel</h2><p>Let’s get back to an online vs online battle: Mondly vs Babbel. We covered Babbel’s key features above. Now let’s dive into what Mondly has to offer:</p><p><strong>Which is better?</strong></p><p>First off, Babbel offers live tutoring support, while Mondly doesn’t. Mondly is great for beginners who want to practice vocabulary whenever they have a spare moment. That said, if your goal is fluency, it may not be the best choice. With limited grammar and speaking skills instruction, think of Mondly as an extremely fun support tool.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=iTalki-vs.-Lingoda>iTalki vs. Lingoda</h2><p>Now, let’s compare iTalki vs Lingoda, two online schools. We’ve explored Lingoda and its flexibility-driven approach above, so let’s discuss iTalki:</p><ul><li><strong>iTalki </strong>lets you choose between one-on-one or group lessons with certified teachers. You can book lessons with different teachers as you go – no subscription is needed. This means you can learn exactly what you want, when you want and choose teachers based on your goals and budget.<br></li></ul><p>One of the coolest features of iTalki is the ability to create a customized curriculum with your teacher or choose courses tailored to specific objectives, like preparing for the IELTS test. Remember, though, that they don’t offer certificates of completion.</p><p><strong>Which is better?</strong></p><p>If you’re on a tight budget or just looking to brush up your skills, iTalki could be a great pick with lessons starting at just €4. Nevertheless, lessons are pay-as-you-go, so you’ll need to stay committed to keeping up a regular schedule. Lingoda, for its part, can help you stay motivated more easily (and earn a certificate!).</p><p><h2 class=headline>Discover Lingoda. Reach your goals.</h2></p><p>Another thing to note is that iTalki offers lessons in dozens of languages, while Lingoda’s curriculum is currently focused on five major world languages: German, English, French, Spanish and Italian. Note that Italian was added in 2024, so the language options are expanding. There are also specific course options, such as advanced Business English, that go beyond the basics.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Comparing-different-language-schools>Comparing different language schools</h2><p>Alright!

Consider your lifestyle and how you like to learn. If you have a hectic schedule, e-learning is ideal. You can connect from anywhere and find programs that fit your timetable and goals. For instance, if you want to fast-track your studies, take the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lingoda Sprint</a>! It’s an intensive two-month language course designed to rapidly improve your language skills. You can choose between either 15 classes/month or even 30 classes/month!</p><p><h2 class=headline>Join the Lingoda Sprint</h2></p><p><br>On the flip side, in-person classes are fantastic if you prefer face-to-face instruction and need a set schedule to stay committed. If your home is a bustling or distracting environment and you don’t have a quiet cafe nearby, in-person classes may also be the right choice. Most importantly, you’ve decided to take this next step. This first decision about online vs offline language schools is important in your language learning journey.
