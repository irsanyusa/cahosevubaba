Stefaniak was <a href=# rel=noopener>last heard from on the evening of Nov. 27</a> — the day before her scheduled flight home — but then disappeared, according to a GoFundMe set up by family members.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Costa Rica’s Judicial Investigation Department’s General Director Walter Espinoza <a href=# rel=noopener>confirmed the arrest</a> of 32-year-old Bismarck Espinosa Martinez, according to ABC-7 in Tampa and other outlets. Authorities said Espinosa Martinez worked as a security guard at the complex where Stefaniak was staying, and lived in the apartment next to Stefaniak’s.

Stefaniak was also reportedly stabbed in the arms and suffered blunt trauma to the head. Police added that the crime was “sexually” motivated.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Authorities said Espinosa Martinez originally told police he helped Stefaniak pack her luggage into a taxi at around 5 a.m. on Nov. 28 but then changed his story, leading police to follow up. They added that Espinosa Martinez, a Nicaraguan native living in Costa Rica since June, is still considered a suspect and that the investigation is ongoing.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The person detained for the homicide was near her, had chances to commit the act and became a suspect through all our investigation.” Espinoza said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Stefaniak’s family confirmed her death on <a href=# rel=noopener>Facebook</a>.

May God bless her soul.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The family said they will continue to post updates on the investigation and “continue asking questions about the involvement of others in Carla’s murder.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“We will make sure this case is not closed like many others in Costa Rica.” the family posted.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Federico Jenkin, the attorney representing the owner of the Airbnb, released a statement to <a href=# rel=noopener>ABC Action </a><a href=# rel=noopener>News</a> announcing they were cooperating with authorities and closing the villa as police continue their investigation. According to Jenkin, Villa Le Mas has been in operation since 2013 and received thousands of guests.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“We are deeply saddened and devastated by the tragic events that occurred last week,” the statement said. “The owners are fully cooperating with the authorities in the investigation and we hope that once the facts are determined, the perpetrator is brought to justice. While the investigation is ongoing, and since the focus of the owners is the comfort of our guests, the facility has been temporarily closed.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The villa, still available to view on <a href=# rel=noopener>Trip Advisor,</a> has mostly favorable reviews, but some called their stay a “nightmare” and “terrible.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The murder rate in the country of 4.9 million has been on the rise, with a record-high of 603 people killed in 2017, <a href=# rel=noopener>Bloomberg</a> reported.
