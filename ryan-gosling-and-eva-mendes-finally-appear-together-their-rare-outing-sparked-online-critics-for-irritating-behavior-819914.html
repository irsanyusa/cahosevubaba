They were joined by their daughters, Esmeralda, 9, and Amada, 8, for the women’s gymnastics uneven bars final at Bercy Arena.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f99/7e9/00403a5d72abab092ffa00cc6a.jpg><p>CYRIL PECQUENARD/SIPA/Sipa Press /East News<span>, </span>CYRIL PECQUENARD/SIPA/Sipa Press/East News</p><p>Eva Mendes, who stepped back from acting to focus on motherhood, and Ryan Gosling have been rarely seen together in recent years. Their last <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>public appearance</a> was in 2015 at a Q&A for Gosling’s directorial debut, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Lost River</i></a>, at the SXSW festival.</p><p>At the 2024 Paris Olympics, Mendes embraced Parisian style in a navy tea-length dress, classic stilettos, and bold square sunglasses, while Gosling opted for a more casual look with a white tank top, plaid shirt, black sunglasses, and a green cap featuring the Olympic rings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/277/977/297d8f5bbdaad59c137506e29b.jpg><p>LOIC VENANCE/AFP/East News</p><p>Even though Eva Mendes and Ryan Gosling tried to keep things low-key at the 2024 Paris Olympics, their choice of accessories didn’t go unnoticed. Fans quickly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pointed</a> out how irritating and odd it was for them to wear sunglasses indoors—a common move by celebs to stay under the radar. One person commented, “The sunglasses. Why do ‘celebrities’ do this? It’s especially irritating during interviews,” while another said, “What’s with the sunglasses? They were watching gymnastics indoors. They look out of place there.”</p><p>These reactions show just how much the couple values their privacy, which is probably why they don’t step out together often. While some people grumbled about their choices, plenty of others praised them for how they looked and the strength of their <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a>. One user said, "I admire that they both took a step back to spend more time with their family," and another added, "Ryan and Eva are just a fabulous couple!" There were also tons of comments about how great they look, both individually and together, "Great looking couple! I’ve always thought she was beautiful."</p><p>In this article, <a href=#>Eva</a> explained why she never attends public events together with her husband.</p><p>Preview photo credit LOIC VENANCE/AFP/East News</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZL%2B6rc1mnqirnJ67qHnAp5tmnaaWeq6xzZ2crGWWnruiuMuyZJqooJqus3nTqJ6erJiav27Ax56gq2Wilr%2Bmec6uq6Kml2LAsa3RpJydZZ%2Bjuaq6xGaaq6GknrC0ecWoqWahoqe2ta3ToqWgZZKataLCyKipZnBhboZygI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
