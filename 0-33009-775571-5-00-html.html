Almost all of them gain the impression that he is several inches taller than his actual 5 ft. n. A six-inch chest expansion helps.</p><p>Postwar Plans. In San Francisco, waiting out the war and trying to keep track of her family, is Mrs. Simon Bolivar Buckner,* who was born Adele Blanc, in New Orleans, but moved to Kentucky "when she was a quadruped." Her elder son, Simon Bolivar III, is a captain in the Signal Corps in France, her younger son, William Claiborne, a plebe at West Point. The daughter, Mary, is studying at the University of California.</p><p>For the postwar period their plans are set. They fell in love with Alaska, bought a homesite in Anchorage and a farm at Homer on the Kenai peninsula. Wild game, including black and grizzly bears, abounds at the farm. A vein of coal lies offshore, and the tide washes up more than enough lumps for heating. The Buckners plan to return there to live. Said the General: "I expect it will take me a solid year to catch up with my hunting and fishing. And I'll be so far away from things I won't be able to exercise a retired general's prerogative of cussing and swearing that the new army has gone to hell since he got out of it."</p><p>But all that is for the future. Right now the General confines his hopes to his favorite toast (invariably drunk in "bourbon and puddle water"): "May you walk in the ashes of Tokyo."</p><p>* The Tenth is the third U.S. Army to appear in the Pacific. The others: Lieut. General Walter Krueger's Sixth, Lieut. General Robert Eichelberger's Eighth, both operating in the Philippines.</p><p>* Mrs. Buckner calls her husband Bolivar; sometimes to rhyme with Oliver, sometimes (with the original Spanish pronunciation) to rhyme with retriever.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6PBprrTZ6uipZVjsLC5jq2gpp1fqMKjv8KroJudomSus8DInKOeZ2BhgHR8j3JjcG9laoRyeZRlZ2lmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
