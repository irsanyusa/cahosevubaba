Investigators previously reported that Farias was experiencing depression after seeing his brother die in front of him, NBC News <a href=# rel=noopener>reports</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Santana maintained that her son was missing throughout the years, but authorities say he returned just a day after his initial disappearance. After Farias was found sleeping in front of an east Houston church in late June, his family released a statement saying that a “good Samaritan located him unresponsive and immediately called police and 911.” Farias was allegedly nonverbal when he was found.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Farias, however, was not transported to the hospital after he refused and was left in the care of his family, authorities said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Police say they had doubts about Farias’ disappearance as officers had gathered several tips that proved that “Rudy was not missing during the eight-year period,” Zamora said. Farias and his mother had spoken to officers multiple times during the past eight years, but had given authorities false information, including fake names and dates of birth, Houston police Lt. Christopher Zamora said during a press conference.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“He made contact with patrol officers out on the street. However, during these contacts, fictitious names and dates of birth were given, misleading officers, and Rudy would remain missing,” Zamora said.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Conflicting reports</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Days after Farias had been reportedly found, neighbors began speaking to<a href=# rel=noopener> local news outlets</a>, saying that they’d regularly seen Farias since his alleged 2015 disappearance.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“He used to come in my garage, chill with my cousin, son, and daughter,” <a href=# rel=noopener>Neighbor Kisha Ross told ABC13</a>. “That boy has never been missing.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Several people had also claimed to see Farias come in and out of his house throughout the past few years, but his mother had <a href=# rel=noopener>identified Farias as her nephew</a>, according to authorities.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Houston Police Chief Troy Finner said that he could not pinpoint the motivation behind Santana’s false claims. Police did acknowledge that giving a fake name to police, which they alleged Farias did at least once, is a crime. But there are ongoing questions about what happened to Farias. “I’m not going to say if he’s a victim or not,” Finner said during Thursday’s press conference.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Farias is now back home with his mother, according to authorities. “The investigation is active, and there are new leads coming in. We’ll continue to follow those leads,” Zamora said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvamlnhHV8jqusnbFdm66ztcCsZKaho6i2r7OMn6auppRiwabEwKxm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
