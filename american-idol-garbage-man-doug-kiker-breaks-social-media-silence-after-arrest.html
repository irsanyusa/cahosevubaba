An unnamed woman called 911 during the incident and cops found probable cause to arrest Doug. <strong>He was booked by the Mobile County&nbsp;Sheriff’s Department&nbsp;and held on a $1,000 bond</strong></strong>. <strong>Doug has remained quiet on social media until now.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-former-american-idol-contestant-doug-kiker-posts-video-on-social-media-after-his-arrest>Former ‘American Idol’ Contestant Doug Kiker Posts Video on Social Media After His Arrest</h2><p>In a video posted on his Instagram account, Doug teased that he is working on something new. He did not mention his arrest. Instead, he asked his supporters to help him out with this new project. Doug urged his followers to come to J Rodgers&nbsp;BBQ in Saraland on Monday morning.</p><p>“Guys, I really, really, really need your help,” he starts. “I’m trying to do my best to make a positive footprint in the world. And I know most of you are working on a Monday but we’re trying to make a movie and I really need you.”</p><p>Doug further explained the movie on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his Facebook page</a> in a series of posts. He was looking for 20 female actors who “must be able act have fun and have the ability to resist a super sexy somewhat unknowingly talented handy capable former garbage man.” Doug also said he would be playing original music at the event.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CRywZJ8B-vL/</p></figure><p>Doug is a father of two. He welcomed a second daughter in May 2020. Doug thanked fans on Facebook for “all the love and support you’ve shown me and my family.” Viewers were first introduced to his story on American Idol in 2020. He sang with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Luke Bryan</a> during his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>unconventional audition</a> and was later brought back to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sing with Rascal Flatts at the finale.</a></p><p>This is not the first time that Doug has called upon his fans to help with his projects. After competing on American Idol, Doug started <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a campaign to help raise money</a> to fund his album. He was seeking $25,000&nbsp;to hire musicians and get in the studio to finish the music. The fundraiser has since been closed after raising $5,500.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/thumbnail_photoByJeffKravitz-KevinWinter_GettyImages.jpeg alt="Jessie J, Billy Porter, Team Up For “I Want Love” Remix" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKacq6GTlrtutcOoo2afkaevorPEZqSapl2ZvLazjKSgpJ2iYq%2BzscCkqmarn5i2oriMppydoZFiwKq4xKeanmWRm8Gmvoyaqaudo6l8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
