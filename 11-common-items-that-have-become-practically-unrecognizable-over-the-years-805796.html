So&nbsp;when we&nbsp;think about Ancient Egypt, for example, we&nbsp;remember the great pyramids and pharaohs but we&nbsp;don’t know much about the way people actually lived there. However, their lives were just as&nbsp;full as&nbsp;ours: they <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>played</a> sports and board games and had housewarming parties.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side </strong>decided to&nbsp;look more into the daily lives of&nbsp;people from different time periods and compared some of&nbsp;the things they used with their modern-day analogs.</p><p><h2>1. Toilet paper</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4b6/b85/b813195c89b938f46b7711dbab.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the West, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>toilet paper</a> became commercially available only in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the nineteenth century. Long before that, in&nbsp;prehistoric times, people were using various natural materials, like moss, seashells, or&nbsp;animal fur for wiping. In&nbsp;Ancient Rome, people opted for a&nbsp;sponge on&nbsp;a&nbsp;stick that was (if&nbsp;it&nbsp;wasn’t already bad enough), communal. Something to&nbsp;keep in&nbsp;mind if&nbsp;you’re planning to&nbsp;time-travel, for sure!</p><p><h2>2. Leather shoes</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5a9/f83/3a39ae5b1a9495083cb17fcb63.jpg><p>Shoes became a&nbsp;necessity a&nbsp;long time ago as&nbsp;people had to&nbsp;protect their feet. The first ones were made of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>materials</a> that were easy to&nbsp;find, like bark, leaves, and so&nbsp;on, but few of&nbsp;those managed to&nbsp;survive in&nbsp;their original form. Later, people started using more advanced materials, like leather. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>oldest</a> known leather shoe is&nbsp;about 5,500 years old.</p><p><h2>3. Eyeliner</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6c7/a78/d70ded51e4b951ae761a593d23.jpg><p>The idea of&nbsp;emphasizing the eyes is&nbsp;not at&nbsp;all new: people of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Ancient Egypt</a> were using this makeup technique thousands of&nbsp;years ago. Both men and women were using kohl around their eyes, not only for beauty purposes but also to&nbsp;protect themselves from the sun. People back then had a&nbsp;surprisingly large arsenal of&nbsp;cosmetics made of&nbsp;soot, galena, burnt almonds, malachite, chrysocolla, and more.</p><p><h2>4. Belt buckle</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/370/e8a/1a1cf45e0d8cc46057c7c68ddb.jpg><p>Belt buckles have <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>changed</a> a&nbsp;lot since they first appeared. In&nbsp;the past, their purpose was decorative to&nbsp;a&nbsp;much greater degree than it&nbsp;is&nbsp;now. Metalsmiths and jewelers did their best to&nbsp;make sure the designs were intricate, often using precious metals and real gems. The Qing buckle in&nbsp;the photo, for example, was made of&nbsp;jade.</p><p><h2>5. Feeding bottles</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c6e/150/66ad6158bca830c7fa8eeac311.jpg><p>Feeding bottles were used in&nbsp;different parts of&nbsp;the world and had properties depending on&nbsp;the time period. Some of&nbsp;them were made of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>metal</a>, and others, of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>glass</a>. The ring-shaped feeding bottle in&nbsp;the picture was used in&nbsp;the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in&nbsp;Japan, and it&nbsp;was made of&nbsp;porcelain.</p><p><h2>6. Hand mirror</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/284/a36/d22ec3532dbdb32929f2ec07b8.jpg><p>Silvered-glass mirrors as&nbsp;we&nbsp;know them now were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>invented</a> in&nbsp;Germany not too long ago, back in&nbsp;1835. However, it&nbsp;doesn’t mean that people from Ancient Egypt had no&nbsp;way of&nbsp;knowing if&nbsp;their <a href=# title=eyeliner data-link=tag>eyeliner</a> was on&nbsp;point&nbsp;— they had mirrors made of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bronze</a>. Even before that, about 8,000 years ago, people in&nbsp;Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) were using mirrors made from ground and polished obsidian (volcanic glass).</p><p><h2>7. City clocks</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/16e/f93/f80d6b5cbead3a720a59f7ed87.jpg><p>Today, it’s very difficult to&nbsp;imagine our lives without watches and clocks, but in&nbsp;ancient times, people had to&nbsp;use sundials, water clocks, and other tools. The first mechanical clock was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>invented</a> in&nbsp;the thirteenth century. Those were elaborate and expensive, and some (like the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Exeter</a> Cathedral astronomical clock in&nbsp;the photo) showed not only time but also the day of&nbsp;the lunar month and the phase of&nbsp;the moon.</p><p><h2>8. Hair comb</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e3a/74f/7bcd8d57e4b0dc6420d295c4e6.jpg><p>Hair combs were used in&nbsp;different civilizations with similar purposes as&nbsp;today: to&nbsp;keep long hair smooth and in&nbsp;place as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;decorate&nbsp;it. One more essential function of&nbsp;hair combs of&nbsp;the past is&nbsp;not at&nbsp;all common right now thanks to&nbsp;modern hygiene&nbsp;— they were used for catching <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lice</a>.</p><p><h2>9. Toothbrush</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4bd/612/60510e58e4801e08d2c6ebf605.jpg><p>People figured out the importance of&nbsp;oral hygiene quite a&nbsp;long time ago. The first measures for having clean teeth included chewing special plants and using various toothpicks. Then (about 1,500 years ago) the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>miswak</a> was invented, which was a&nbsp;special oral hygiene accessory made from the Salvadora persica tree. Some people still use it&nbsp;today instead of&nbsp;a&nbsp;more traditional <a href=# title=toothbrush data-link=tag>toothbrush</a>.</p><p><h2>10. Enema syringe</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/032/e09/b7eaad57be967b5f57283375fa.jpg><p>Enema <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>syringes</a> were used more frequently in&nbsp;medicine in&nbsp;the past to&nbsp;introduce medication into the body before hypodermic syringes were invented. Later, another <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>type</a> of&nbsp;these syringes appeared. They were made of&nbsp;metal and had pistons and reservoirs. Both of&nbsp;them look nothing like what we’re used to&nbsp;now: a&nbsp;rubber bulb and a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;plastic tubing.</p><p><h2>11. Pillow</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/abd/4c6/1659c5527886aa64be99b8720f.jpg><p>Instead of&nbsp;the soft cozy pillows we’re used to&nbsp;today, people in&nbsp;Ancient Egypt and some other civilizations were sleeping on&nbsp;special wooden, ceramic, or&nbsp;stone <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>headrests</a>. This wasn’t as&nbsp;impractical as&nbsp;it&nbsp;might seem at&nbsp;first. It&nbsp;helped the person to&nbsp;cool down in&nbsp;a&nbsp;hot climate, kept the intricate hairstyle intact, and prevented insect infestations&nbsp;— all for the low price of&nbsp;very probable neck pain.</p><p>In&nbsp;your opinion, which of&nbsp;the things we&nbsp;use today will change the most in&nbsp;the future?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5yecKopKannmK2tbHMrGStoJGpeqmt1Z5km52TpLqmec%2BrmJysmZiurbjYZqynqpWYvKi6yLOYm6SVYry3sdFmq6GdXa6yor7SZm9pbWdug3A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
