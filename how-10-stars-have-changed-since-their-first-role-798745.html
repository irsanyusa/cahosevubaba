We&nbsp;think some of&nbsp;them still look ambitious. Do&nbsp;you agree?</p><p><h2>Alicia Silverstone</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3e7/d84/3aa22e5e2baef9ecf4f6b33efa.jpg><p>At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;6, <a href=# title="Alicia Silverstone" data-link=tag>Alicia Silverstone</a> <a href=#>started</a> working as&nbsp;a&nbsp;model, appearing in&nbsp;TV projects and winning viewers’ hearts. She debuted in&nbsp;The Wonder Years in&nbsp;1992 and she got the nickname, “dream girl.” After her role as&nbsp;Batgirl in&nbsp;Batman &&nbsp;Robin, which is&nbsp;<a href=#>considered</a> to&nbsp;be&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the worst films of&nbsp;all time, Silverstone’s career has taken her to&nbsp;different places, from Bad Therapy to&nbsp;The Baby-Sitters Club. She’s also worked as&nbsp;a&nbsp;voice actress, appearing in&nbsp;the Canadian children’s show, Braceface and Masters of&nbsp;the Universe: Revelation.</p><p><h2>Angelina Jolie</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/671/166/c6e67b5b00a566119830da4305.jpg><p>This beautiful actress <a href=#>first</a> appeared on&nbsp;screen as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child, in&nbsp;the comedy Lookin’ to&nbsp;Get Out. Her mother and father were also in&nbsp;this film: actor Jon Voight and actress Marcheline Bertrand. Today, we&nbsp;can see <a href=# title="Angelina Jolie" data-link=tag>Angelina Jolie</a> in&nbsp;Maleficent: Mistress of&nbsp;Evil, and in&nbsp;2021, we&nbsp;expect the film The Eternals to&nbsp;be&nbsp;<a href=#>released</a> and it&nbsp;will reveal what happens after Avengers: Endgame.</p><p><h2>Nicole Kidman</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/387/e16/37db705a9aaaba3af2f9b42719.jpg><p>This Australian actress <a href=#>debuted</a> in&nbsp;the film, <i>Bush Christmas,</i> and then continued her path in&nbsp;Hollywood. She had a&nbsp;second wave of&nbsp;popularity when she appeared in&nbsp;Big Little Lies and last year, the film Bombshell was released and it&nbsp;was really controversial. It&nbsp;was based on&nbsp;real events when 2&nbsp;women started a&nbsp;revolution against their boss.</p><p><h2>Elizabeth Hurley</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/07a/e33/661b17571faf2b2b37c5a7281f.jpg><p>22-year-old Elizabeth Hurley sang the part of&nbsp;Marietta in&nbsp;the <a href=#>film</a>, Aria. After that, she appeared in&nbsp;several successful British and Hollywood movies. We&nbsp;saw her as&nbsp;an&nbsp;attractive devil in&nbsp;Bedazzled and then the English beauty decided to&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;producing movies and she started her own company. Some of&nbsp;her later roles include playing Queen Helena in&nbsp;The Royals and Morgan Le&nbsp;Fay in&nbsp;Runaways, where she looks absolutely gorgeous.</p><p><h2>Ben Stiller</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/23e/97c/d64f85552b9229c9fc568257e7.jpg><p>Ben Stiller <a href=#>debuted</a> in&nbsp;the Kate &&nbsp;Allie television series. Since then, his career has taken an&nbsp;upward trajectory and he&nbsp;now has a&nbsp;long list of&nbsp;movies under his belt: more than 60&nbsp;roles and successful experiences as&nbsp;a&nbsp;director and screenwriter. And we&nbsp;love Stiller for hit movies like Night at&nbsp;the Museum and Meet the Parents. One of&nbsp;his more recent films was Brad’s Status, about a&nbsp;man who questions his life choices.</p><p><h2>Rose McGowan</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/075/0c5/9cbaac5ad091b4ba8435d6a23a.jpg><p>The bright and controversial Rose McGowan first <a href=#>appeared</a> on&nbsp;screen in&nbsp;Encino Man. She also appeared The Doom Generation as&nbsp;Amy, and for that, she got an&nbsp;Independent Spirit Award. Then, she played many other roles that made her a&nbsp;star, like 112 episodes as&nbsp;Paige Matthews in&nbsp;Charmed, and as&nbsp;Cherry Darling, who saves humanity from zombies in&nbsp;Planet Terror. Some of&nbsp;her most recent roles were in&nbsp;Indecision IV&nbsp;and appearances on&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV series Chopped.</p><p>Later, the actress became interested in&nbsp;music and wrote the book, Brave.</p><p><h2>Kirstie Alley</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1ec/833/4b5bec5482997ad239c4d569dc.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the ’90s, Kirstie <a href=#>was</a> a&nbsp;star in&nbsp;It&nbsp;Takes Two and Look Who’s Talking, after making her first appearance in&nbsp;Star Trek II: The Wrath of&nbsp;Khan. Then, she disappeared from the big screen because she had problems regarding the extra weight she’d gained, which is&nbsp;why she only appeared in&nbsp;different reality shows like Kirstie Alley’s Big Life. But she managed to&nbsp;get back in&nbsp;shape and return to&nbsp;the screen. You might have seen her in&nbsp;The Goldbergs. One of&nbsp;her most recent roles was in&nbsp;Lifetime’s You Can’t Take My&nbsp;Daughter.</p><p><h2>Jennifer Grey</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f2f/3e4/cb720853e481761326e6c5adc1.jpg><p>Jennifer Grey made her film debut in&nbsp;Reckless. In&nbsp;1986, she <a href=#>appeared</a> in&nbsp;the film, Ferris Bueller’s Day Off and one year later she got her big break when she got a&nbsp;part in&nbsp;Dirty Dancing alongside Patrick Swayze. Despite this great start, her career didn’t go&nbsp;very well. She’s had to&nbsp;play supporting roles and parts in&nbsp;TV series. Finally, she got a&nbsp;leading role in&nbsp;Wind, but the film wasn’t very successful. You may have also caught Grey in&nbsp;episodes of&nbsp;House, M.D., Grey’s Anatomy, and The Conners.</p><p><h2>Robert Downey&nbsp;Jr.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8ad/73e/6d61375681a61a445d71cbe660.jpg><p>Robert’s career <a href=#>started</a> in&nbsp;1970 with the film Pound. But in&nbsp;his early work, he&nbsp;wasn’t even credited. His first full-fledged role was in&nbsp;Baby It’s You. Today, Robert is&nbsp;a&nbsp;Golden Globe winner, and an&nbsp;Oscar and Emmy nominee. He’s an&nbsp;extremely popular actor. He’s played Tony Stark and Dolittle and we’re looking forward to&nbsp;seeing him in&nbsp;All-Star Weekend, Sherlock Holmes&nbsp;3, and Black Widow.</p><p><h2>Renée Zellweger</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cdf/d00/28fe36593c8cd8ea35d76cc394.jpg><p>The 2-time Oscar <a href=#>winner</a> and owner of&nbsp;4&nbsp;Golden Globes started her career by&nbsp;debuting in&nbsp;Dazed and Confused.

Today, Zellweger is&nbsp;a&nbsp;successful actress and her most recent work was on&nbsp;the Netflix show, What&nbsp;If.</p><p><h2>Meg Ryan</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/990/bc7/f1089c50859b9937efd40286ed.jpg><p>After making her debut in&nbsp;Rich and Famous in&nbsp;1981, Meg Ryan <a href=#>appeared</a> in&nbsp;the film, Top Gun with Tom Cruise. Her role was so&nbsp;memorable that she was quoted and considered a&nbsp;rising star. In&nbsp;the ’90s, she had a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;fans thanks to&nbsp;movies like Sleepless in&nbsp;Seattle, and When Harry Met Sally... And Meg Ryan’s haircuts were just as&nbsp;popular as&nbsp;Rachel’s hair (from Friends) would eventually&nbsp;be. One of&nbsp;her later roles was in&nbsp;Ithaca alongside Tom Hanks.</p><p><h2>Christoph Waltz</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c41/9c8/7016ad55aebd95f9bad8796290.jpg><p>The Austrian actor became widely popular thanks to&nbsp;his role as&nbsp;Standartenführer Hans Landa in&nbsp;the Quentin Tarantino film, Inglourious Basterds. He&nbsp;<a href=#>started</a> his career almost 40&nbsp;years ago in&nbsp;the black and white film, Kopfstand. Now, he&nbsp;has more than 60&nbsp;roles under his belt, one of&nbsp;the more recent ones being Alita: Battle Angel. And this year, we&nbsp;hope to&nbsp;see him in&nbsp;the twenty-fifth James Bond movie, No&nbsp;Time to&nbsp;Die.</p><p><h2>Eva Longoria</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cac/e5d/c48596513d9c28827321c0324d.jpg><p>The star of&nbsp;Desperate Housewives <a href=#>started</a> her career in&nbsp;an&nbsp;episode in&nbsp;Beverly Hills, 90210.
