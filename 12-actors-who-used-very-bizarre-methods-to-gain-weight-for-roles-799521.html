Even though many visual effects can be&nbsp;added with computer graphics, nothing replaces real, authentic looks. To&nbsp;create the best experience for&nbsp;us, our favorite actors sometimes have to&nbsp;take on&nbsp;incredibly difficult challenges.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> is&nbsp;amazed by&nbsp;how these 12&nbsp;actors transformed their bodies for specific movie roles. Some of&nbsp;them may send chills down your spine while others can charge you with motivation. But we’re sure none of&nbsp;these stories will leave you indifferent!</p><p><h2>1. Jared Leto&nbsp;— Chapter&nbsp;27</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ca6/09b/dc81f95665b26541fd8aea40f3.jpg><p>To&nbsp;play Mark David Chapman, John Lennon’s assassin, <a href=# title="Jared Leto" data-link=tag>Jared Leto</a> used ice cream. Leto microwaved pints of&nbsp;it, then mixed some olive oil in&nbsp;together with soy sauce. After all the preparations, he&nbsp;drank the mixture in&nbsp;one gulp. Gaining so&nbsp;much weight was way harder for him than starving for other <a href=#>roles</a>. Moreover, this abrupt change took a&nbsp;toll on&nbsp;his body&nbsp;— Leto had to&nbsp;use a&nbsp;wheelchair.</p><p><h2>2. Colin Farrell&nbsp;— The Lobster</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9c3/ddf/5b643255e6a3e92481dbea8acd.jpg><p>For his role, the Irish actor gained 45&nbsp;pounds in&nbsp;2&nbsp;months. He&nbsp;stopped exercising and doing any movement at&nbsp;all, asking his <a href=#>sister</a> to&nbsp;drive him around. He&nbsp;also changed his diet and consumed around 4,000 calories per meal. “2&nbsp;cheeseburgers, fries, and Coca-Colas, and 2&nbsp;slices of&nbsp;chocolate cake at&nbsp;10&nbsp;a.m. is&nbsp;not that fun&nbsp;— and&nbsp;I love cheese­burgers,” <a href=#>recalls</a> Farrell. In&nbsp;addition, just like Jared Leto, he&nbsp;microwaved ice cream and drank&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>3. Sylvester Stallone&nbsp;— Cop Land</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/92b/53e/0544ec5d85a5a0df1667e327b8.jpg><p>Stallone had to&nbsp;gain 40&nbsp;pounds to&nbsp;play a&nbsp;chubby sheriff. His strict diet regimen consisted of&nbsp;<a href=# title=pancakes data-link=tag>pancakes</a> and fries. Lots of&nbsp;them. For example, his breakfasts would consist of&nbsp;entire blueberry <a href=#>cheesecakes</a>, and stacks of&nbsp;French toast covered with quarts of&nbsp;whipped cream, <a href=# title="peanut butter" data-link=tag>peanut butter</a>, and oatmeal cookies. On&nbsp;top of&nbsp;that, he&nbsp;chased it&nbsp;all down with half a&nbsp;quart of&nbsp;chocolate milk.</p><p><h2>4. The Rock&nbsp;— Hercules</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6a0/a25/3ed2c1532dbb670cee3133569f.jpg><p>This time, The Rock needed to&nbsp;gain even more muscles than he&nbsp;already had. For 8&nbsp;months he&nbsp;followed a&nbsp;very strict <a href=#>diet</a> and workout plan, consuming approximately 4,500 calories a&nbsp;day. He&nbsp;ate around 7&nbsp;<a href=#>meals</a> a&nbsp;day that included combinations of&nbsp;<a href=# title=chicken data-link=tag>chicken</a>, halibut, egg whites, oatmeal, white rice, baked potatoes, <a href=# title=broccoli data-link=tag>broccoli</a>, asparagus, peppers, and mushrooms.</p><p><h2>5. Christian Bale&nbsp;— American Hustle</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d59/c1a/8490cf57a1829f02ba6d50f8c9.jpg><p><a href=# title="Christian Bale" data-link=tag>Christian Bale</a> is&nbsp;known for his unimaginable transformations for different roles: he&nbsp;can go&nbsp;from a&nbsp;very skinny dude to&nbsp;a&nbsp;200-lb man with ease. When he&nbsp;acted in&nbsp;American Hustle, he&nbsp;went from 185&nbsp;lb to&nbsp;228&nbsp;lb and allowed himself to&nbsp;eat as&nbsp;much fast-food as&nbsp;he&nbsp;wanted. “I&nbsp;ate lots of&nbsp;doughnuts, a&nbsp;whole lot of&nbsp;cheeseburgers, and whatever&nbsp;I could get my&nbsp;hands&nbsp;on. I&nbsp;literally ate anything that came my&nbsp;way,” shared the <a href=#>actor</a>.</p><p><h2>6. Charlize Theron&nbsp;— Monster</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bfc/b84/73539d5e678183c499b2b33cfd.jpg><p>She gained 30&nbsp;pounds to&nbsp;play the serial killer, Aileen Wuornos. And the process wasn’t easy for her at&nbsp;all as&nbsp;she made herself consume a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;processed foods and sugar. She kept macaroni and cheese by&nbsp;her bed and even set herself alarms in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the night to&nbsp;get up&nbsp;and eat&nbsp;it. “I&nbsp;would wake up&nbsp;and&nbsp;I would just eat it&nbsp;— I&nbsp;would just, like, shove it&nbsp;down my&nbsp;throat,” she <a href=#>shared</a>. Such an&nbsp;unhealthy diet affected her mood and the actress felt very depressed.</p><p><h2>7. George Clooney&nbsp;— Syriana</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/caf/78d/9ed99452089418833b7932a906.jpg><p>The actor had to&nbsp;gain approximately 30&nbsp;pounds and had only one month to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it. He&nbsp;made himself eat around 9&nbsp;meals a&nbsp;day. “So&nbsp;my&nbsp;job was just to&nbsp;eat as&nbsp;fast as&nbsp;I&nbsp;could, as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;I could&nbsp;— but mostly you just ate until you wanted to&nbsp;throw&nbsp;up, and made sure you didn’t throw&nbsp;up. So&nbsp;my&nbsp;job for a&nbsp;month was eating,” <a href=#>recalls</a> Clooney.</p><p><h2>8. Hilary Swank&nbsp;— Million Dollar Baby</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6ee/562/23e04d592ba541e69024bd40c8.jpg><p>Hilary Swank had no&nbsp;mercy on&nbsp;herself while training for this role. Firstly, she underwent 2.5 hours of&nbsp;boxing and 1.5 to&nbsp;2&nbsp;hours of&nbsp;lifting weights every day, 6&nbsp;days a&nbsp;week. She had meals every 1.5 hours and consumed 210 grams of&nbsp;protein daily. “With a&nbsp;meal, I&nbsp;would drink my&nbsp;egg whites because&nbsp;I could never eat 8&nbsp;to&nbsp;12&nbsp;egg whites in&nbsp;a&nbsp;sitting. It’s just the worst thing ever,” <a href=#>says</a> the actress. To&nbsp;let her body rest after such harsh training, she’d sleep for 9&nbsp;hours but had to&nbsp;wake up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the night to&nbsp;drink protein shakes. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, she gained 19&nbsp;pounds of&nbsp;muscle in&nbsp;90&nbsp;days!</p><p><h2>9. Matt Damon&nbsp;— The Informant!</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ab9/15d/028e0c5ca183e58f9c69056405.jpg><p><a href=# title="Matt Damon" data-link=tag>Matt Damon</a> actually enjoyed the process of&nbsp;getting fatter. For his role in&nbsp;The Informant!, he&nbsp;didn’t limit himself at&nbsp;all in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;food. “I&nbsp;definitely got doughy. I&nbsp;started eating like crazy and drinking dark beer. Between meals on&nbsp;set, I’d eat a #1 value meal at&nbsp;McDonald’s and then Doritos on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;it. It&nbsp;was absolute heaven,” <a href=#>shares</a> the actor.</p><p><h2>10. Bradley Cooper&nbsp;— American Sniper</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/17e/61e/29fa9351e8abf78ec3debcf64d.jpg><p>To&nbsp;portray SEAL Chris Kyle, Bradley Cooper had to&nbsp;work out with a&nbsp;personal trainer. He&nbsp;had only 10&nbsp;weeks to&nbsp;<a href=#>gain</a> more than 40&nbsp;pounds of&nbsp;muscles for that role. Cooper trained twice a&nbsp;day&nbsp;— his first workout started at&nbsp;5&nbsp;a.m. and the second, late in&nbsp;the afternoon. And the hardest part was when his trainer had to&nbsp;force-feed him twice a&nbsp;day with over 5,000&nbsp;calories. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;real shock to&nbsp;his body, as&nbsp;Bradley had to&nbsp;eat every 55&nbsp;minutes.</p><p><h2>11. Matthew McConaughey&nbsp;— Gold</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/529/f9d/a2805b578fb627a34e69b69d47.jpg><p>Putting on&nbsp;47&nbsp;pounds in&nbsp;6&nbsp;months was an&nbsp;enjoyable process for Mattew McConaughey. “My&nbsp;favorite food is&nbsp;cheeseburgers, so&nbsp;I was eating cheeseburgers all the time. I&nbsp;was making cheeseburgers. I&nbsp;was trying out all these fast food restaurants that I’ve never had, or&nbsp;I’ve only had one time,” <a href=#>says</a> the actor. “The only thing that gets tiring is&nbsp;the thought of&nbsp;quitting,” he&nbsp;adds.</p><p><h2>12. Emma Stone&nbsp;— Battle of&nbsp;the Sexes</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a0a/bce/867b3b51a88aeaf83cccd81100.jpg><p>The petite Emma Stone had to&nbsp;transform her dancer-like body to&nbsp;look extra fit to&nbsp;play Billie Jean King. To&nbsp;put on&nbsp;around 15&nbsp;pounds of&nbsp;muscle, Emma did around 3&nbsp;months of&nbsp;intensive weight <a href=#>training</a> and exercised from 3&nbsp;to&nbsp;5&nbsp;times a&nbsp;week (she sometimes even hit her training sessions twice a&nbsp;day). She was able to&nbsp;do&nbsp;deadlifts with 185 pounds of&nbsp;weight and push-ups with chains on&nbsp;her back.</p><p>Have you ever gone through drastic body transformations yourself?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5zecCcq6iqo2LEqbuMrqqenF2rsrPFjJugs5mip7JuucStn6ico2LBsHnGmqCnZaeatqi002adqKpdp7ytsdJmbnJxZWd%2BcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
