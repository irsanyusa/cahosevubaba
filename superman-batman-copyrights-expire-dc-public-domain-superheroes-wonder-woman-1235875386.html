Snyder’s vision for Wonder Woman was equally unorthodox, with visuals featuring a superheroine who brandished the decapitated heads of her conquered enemies like an ISIS jihadi.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Warner Bros. and DC Studios — which hold a firm grip on their intellectual property — rejected Snyder’s ideas, which were deemed “super creepy,” according to a source familiar with the back and forth. (DC declined to comment for this story. A representative for Snyder did not respond to a request for comment.) But in the next decade, artists and rival studios won’t need permission to create their own take on the characters.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">A sad fact of Hollywood is that while superheroes never truly die, all copyrights do. On Jan. 1, Disney lost control of “Steamboat Willie,” and within 24 hours two horror-comedies starring Mickey Mouse were announced. The DC characters are the next major expirations looming on the horizon. Superman and Lois Lane will enter the public domain in 2034, followed by Batman in 2035, the Joker in 2036 and Wonder Woman in 2037.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Chris Sims, a comic book author and Batman expert, expects a flood of unauthorized Batman comics to hit the stands as soon as the copyright expires.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“There’s going to be 100 of them,” he says. “They’re going to have them ready to go.” Movie producers will also be able to make their own versions — much as they already do with public domain characters like Dracula and Robin Hood — though in the beginning they will have to stick to the original versions of the characters.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“You get Batman, but you don’t get Robin,” Sims says. “You get Superman, but you don’t get kryptonite.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The initial Superman could only leap — not fly. “Those characteristics are going to fall into the public domain one by one,” says Amanda Schreyer, media and entertainment lawyer at Morse.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">DC has been preparing for this for years. At a press event in 2023, CEO James Gunn noted that the next Superman film will introduce characters from “The Authority,” a comic series that launched in 1999, in part because the Superman copyright is about to expire.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Jay Kogan, DC’s deputy general counsel, laid out a strategy to protect characters that fall into the public domain in a 2001 article. Since only the older versions lose protection, he urged: “Keep ’em fresh and up-to-date.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“By gradually changing the literary and visual characteristics of a character over time, a character owner can keep whatever the then-current image of the character is as the de facto standard in the public consciousness,” he wrote.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The company has done a good job of updating Superman, argues Steven Beer, an IP lawyer at Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard & Smith.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“The public’s perception is the contemporary Superman. It’s distinctive,” he says. “That gives them a lot of protection.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Another tactic: Maintain a high level of quality control.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“The public should be conditioned to view any works from unrelated parties featuring a trademark owner’s characters as second-rate knockoffs,” Kogan wrote.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Kogan also suggested that trademarks could be used to block the use of a character’s name, image and slogan even after the copyright expires.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">But trademark is not a cloak of immunity, argues Jennifer Jenkins, director of Duke’s Center for the Study of the Public Domain. “That only prevents uses that are likely to cause consumer confusion about source or sponsorship,” she says.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In other words, the characters’ names should be fair game, so long as it’s clear that the depiction is not coming from DC.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“You could still create a Superman horror movie or Batman horror movie,” says Jonathan Steinsapir, an IP attorney at KHIKS. “You just need to be careful about how you advertise it and how you use images of Superman in a branding sense.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">DC has done a careful job of tying the characters to itself by trademarking the terms “Man of Steel” and “Caped Crusader,” as well as Superman’s “S” and Batman’s logo.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“The bat symbol is a very strong mark,” Schreyer says. “That is going to limit what subsequent creators can do.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Even so, expect the mid-2030s to see a glut of off-brand superhero content.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“People will make a run at these characters because there’s money to be made,” says Mark Waid, a comic book author and historian best known for his work on DC Comics titles like “Superman: Birthright.” “Or how about Superman versus Godzilla. It’s a gray area. But this town works on the speed of capitalism, right? That’s how we work.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Sims believes more superhero comics will be a good thing. But the idea that there will be a Superman renaissance is oversold, he says.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“It’s gonna come down to execution,” Sims says. “There’s one company that’s used to doing it.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Steinsapir says nothing would keep Snyder from making a non-Warners film featuring the DC troika.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Zack Snyder could reshoot it and make his own new iteration of it,” he says. “You just need to be careful. For example, he definitely couldn’t call it ‘Justice League.’”</p><h4 class="o-nav__title lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-font-family-secondary o-nav__title a-content-ignore u-line-height-140 u-letter-spacing-0002">Read More About:</h4><ul class="o-nav__list lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-flex lrv-a-space-children-horizontal lrv-a-space-children--050 lrv-u-align-items-center lrv-u-flex-wrap-wrap lrv-u-justify-content-center" aria-labelledby><li class=o-nav__list-item><a class="c-link lrv-a-unstyle-link a-content-ignore lrv-u-color-black u-font-family-secondary lrv-u-whitespace-nowrap u-color-action-blue:hover u-font-size-18@desktop-xl u-font-size-18@tablet u-letter-spacing-0002" href=#>Batman,</a></li><li class=o-nav__list-item><a class="c-link lrv-a-unstyle-link a-content-ignore lrv-u-color-black u-font-family-secondary lrv-u-whitespace-nowrap u-color-action-blue:hover u-font-size-18@desktop-xl u-font-size-18@tablet u-letter-spacing-0002" href=#>Dc Entertainment,</a></li><li class=o-nav__list-item><a class="c-link lrv-a-unstyle-link a-content-ignore lrv-u-color-black u-font-family-secondary lrv-u-whitespace-nowrap u-color-action-blue:hover u-font-size-18@desktop-xl u-font-size-18@tablet u-letter-spacing-0002" href=#>Superman</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiukae2psDYZ5qopV9nfXOAjpugs2eemsS0e9Kup56qnZa7bq7AraSapl2YvLHF0aKeoayjYrK5vMirnGack2K9tq7LoppmnJ%2Birqq6jKysqZ2inbKzu8SsZLCnnpmys3nWqKSapl1mf3SBl3BsbHBmZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
