The Sundance Film Festival, for example, is an event that a majority of U.S. adults know about,&nbsp;according to a recent Morning Consult poll. Fifty-nine percent of adults said they have heard of Sundance, 32 percent said they have not heard of Sundance. In contrast, 56 percent of people said they have not heard of South by Southwest, also known as SXSW.</p><p><a href=#><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BRD7.png alt width=1957 height=1561 sizes="(max-width: 1957px) 100vw, 1957px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BRD9-mobile.png alt width=960 height=1469 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Only 16 percent of people report having attended a large industry conference, and 26 percent say they would consider attending one.
