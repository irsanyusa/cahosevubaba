Being fortunate enough to&nbsp;have successful relatives can pave certain paths, but it&nbsp;can also have its drawbacks, like having to&nbsp;carry the burden of&nbsp;repeating similar success. In&nbsp;the case of&nbsp;actress Elizabeth Olsen, she successfully overcame being the sister of&nbsp;2&nbsp;celebrities, the Olsen twins, and managed to&nbsp;forge a&nbsp;great career on&nbsp;her own.</p><p>At&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>, we’ll tell you how Elizabeth Olsen managed to&nbsp;overcome the fear of&nbsp;being overshadowed by&nbsp;her sisters, and now she’s a&nbsp;big star in&nbsp;blockbuster movies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/060/b8e/b2657c56e09e7bfb8f71fb8155.jpg><p>Many of&nbsp;us remember twins Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen as&nbsp;the adorable Michelle Tanner in&nbsp;the legendary sitcom, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Full House</i></a>, and they are considered youth icons of&nbsp;the 1990s. In&nbsp;this context, their younger sister, Elizabeth, naturally felt attracted to&nbsp;the world of&nbsp;acting, so&nbsp;she had brief appearances in&nbsp;her sisters’ films, such as&nbsp;<i>How the West Was Fun</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/258/d19/48cfa351e282a34fad816725dd.jpg><p>Although she seemed destined to&nbsp;follow the path of&nbsp;<a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> success, Elizabeth felt at&nbsp;age 10&nbsp;that such a&nbsp;world was not for her. “I&nbsp;missed my&nbsp;sports team, my&nbsp;dance class, and all my&nbsp;extracurricular activities at&nbsp;school,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview.</p><p>Although, Mary-Kate and Ashley’s shadow conditioned her when it&nbsp;came to&nbsp;imagining herself starting a&nbsp;career in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a>. “I&nbsp;guess&nbsp;I understood what nepotism was inherently at&nbsp;10&nbsp;years old. I&nbsp;don’t know if&nbsp;I knew the word, but it&nbsp;bothered me&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;associated with it&nbsp;at&nbsp;a&nbsp;young age.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8ac/53e/1d090b573e8beb6120b7ec213b.jpg><p>Finally, her love for acting was stronger than anything else she was doing, and Elizabeth <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>began</a> studying at&nbsp;the Tisch School of&nbsp;the Arts at&nbsp;New York University. At&nbsp;first, she considered changing her last name to&nbsp;avoid being associated with her sisters, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>introducing</a> herself as&nbsp;Elizabeth Chase, although she finally ended up&nbsp;proudly using her original last name.</p><p>After stumbling through a&nbsp;few auditions, like for the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>role</a> of&nbsp;Daenerys in&nbsp;<i>Game of&nbsp;Thrones</i>, she finally landed her first major role in&nbsp;the independent film, <i>Martha Marcy May Marlene</i>, for which she received great critical acclaim, proving to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;great start to&nbsp;her career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a52/01f/87cb315833801a38fdf4f12116.jpg><p>However, the role that would give her the big push to&nbsp;gain fame in&nbsp;her career was that of&nbsp;Wanda Maximoff, known in&nbsp;the comics as&nbsp;the Scarlet Witch in&nbsp;the Marvel Cinematic Universe. She debuted in&nbsp;that role in&nbsp;the film, <i>Avengers: Age of&nbsp;Ultro</i>n, and has since appeared in&nbsp;5&nbsp;films, in&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;the series, <i>WandaVision</i>, where she is&nbsp;the main character.</p><p>Although the character clearly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>changed</a> her life and career, she has not always felt entirely comfortable playing&nbsp;it. For example, she once complained about having to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;low-cut suit unnecessarily. “I&nbsp;like corsets, but I’d like it&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;higher. I’d like it&nbsp;to&nbsp;cover me&nbsp;a&nbsp;little higher&nbsp;up.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/024/32f/b1ee215603899d7a5a42dcf2ec.jpg><p>Fortunately, as&nbsp;the character and, consequently, Elizabeth, gained prominence, things changed. In&nbsp;<i>WandaVision</i>, a&nbsp;series in&nbsp;which she starred alongside Paul Bettany, she was able to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>participate</a> in&nbsp;the creative direction of&nbsp;the famous costume seen in&nbsp;the Scarlet Witch comics. In&nbsp;addition, in&nbsp;that show, she received high praise for her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>performance</a>, for which she was nominated for an&nbsp;Emmy for Best Actress in&nbsp;a&nbsp;limited series.</p><p>Today, Wanda is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the fundamental pillars of&nbsp;the Marvel Cinematic Universe and is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most important characters in&nbsp;its latest release, <i>Doctor Strange in&nbsp;the Multiverse</i> <i>of&nbsp;Madness</i>. In&nbsp;this way, Elizabeth Olsen has shown that fear should not paralyze&nbsp;us and that we&nbsp;must follow our dreams, no&nbsp;matter how difficult the path may seem.</p><p>With which relative have you shared a&nbsp;profession?
