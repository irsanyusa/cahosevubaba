The primary reasons given for watching video in the car is to keep children entertained and to pass time while waiting for someone or something.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The survey found that short videos (such as YouTube or TikTok) are the primary type of video consumed, except for during long road trips or passing time while charging an electric vehicle, for which movies and TV shows are more often chosen (most commonly from SVOD services such as Netflix and streamed using a data plan).&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Just 3% of respondents, according to the report, currently watch video to pass time while charging an EV, but that could change as adoption of electric vehicles rises. In fact, according to the DTS report, 87% believe EV sales will eventually exceed those of gas-powered autos, and of those, 37% expect this will occur within the next five years.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Among other DTS results, the smartphone is currently the most popular in-car screen, but, again, this could change as new autos enter the market. Also, 56% of respondents said they would like a front cabin screen, while 58% would want a rear cabin screen built into their next car.&nbsp;That interest was the highest from ultra-luxury car buyers, with 91% saying they want front cabin screens and 88% desiring a screen in the rear.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Asked to rate the importance of entertainment options for new car purchases, AM/FM radio tops the list, though, according to the DTS report, “while most of the top features of importance are audio-focused, we see potential to excel in providing high-quality video experience to consumers. Many of these features are not yet available to all consumers, which explains why the importance isn’t as high.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Asked what they see as very important features to have offered in their next cars, 20% of consumers surveyed say seamless entertainment (meaning they can start watching something at home and finish in the car), 19% say subscription video services, and just 6% say pay-per-show/movie.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The biggest opportunity for video entertainment features in the car is in the high end. For instance, 20% of luxury car buyers and 33% of ultra-luxury car buyers (though 12% of all buyers) say they would like an Imax movie experience that “makes your car a theater on wheels.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">While none of this will happen overnight, this survey supports additional signs that consumers may have more time for, thus interest, in in-vehicle entertainment down the road: 84% of survey respondents believe safe, fully automated self-driving cars will become commonplace, while 64% think people will give up having their own cars in favor of car-sharing services or other options.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiukae2psDYZ5qopV%2BrtrF7wpqpZpqlrrKzv4ysmqudlaPAbrXNZq2eoJmYuaZ5xKernqqklravucSnq2ZpYmiDcYCSb21uZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
