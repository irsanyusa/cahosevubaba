Through the seasons, the <a href=#>America’s Got Talent</a> and Britain’s Got Talent stages have hosted acts from backgrounds far and wide. But no matter where you are in life, you can still pursue your dreams. These contestants sure have proven to us all that age is just a number.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-josefina-monasterio>Josefina Monasterio</h2><p>Last year, the entertaining and charismatic <a href=#>Josefina Monasterio</a> took to the AGT stage at 73-years-old. She impressively revealed her act as a bodybuilder and showed off her amazing physique on stage. Despite being in her 70s, Josefina showed the world that you can be fit and fierce at any age.</p><p>Her act included showing off her muscles in a series of poses. In a signature style, she notably shouted the word “pow” between flexes. Host <a href=#>Terry Crews </a>even got in on the action toward the end of her performance to relive his bodybuilding days. While Josefina was a breath of fresh air, she ultimately did not advance to the next round of the competition.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/MF-D_PTnqjk</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mighty-atom-jr>Mighty Atom Jr.</h2><p>This 93-year-old strongman impressed us all at his AGT audition. On season nine, Mighty Atom Jr pulled a 3000 pound station wagon with three passengers inside. He pulled the vehicle not with his hands, but with his teeth clenched on a leather bite pad. It was truly a sight to see.</p><p>While Howard Stern voted “no” Heidi Klum, Mel B, and Howie Mandel sent him through to the next round. He performed during Judgement Week, where he pulled a 5000 pound vehicle with six passengers inside. While impressive, the act was not strong enough to send him to the Quarterfinals.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/NxLEkq0ikFU</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-paddy-and-nico>Paddy and Nico</h2><p>Paddy and Nico are a salsa-dancing duo who made it to the final on series eight of Britain’s Got Talent. With quite a noticeable age difference between the two, Paddy proudly danced her heart out at 79-years-old. The duo began their routine with a seemingly boring ballroom routine, which <a href=#>Simon Cowell buzzed</a>. Just then, the tempo picked up before switching to an exciting salsa routine that incorporated a number of spins and lifts. In the end, Cowell apologized for his buzzer and called the act “extraordinary.” In the finals, the duo finished 9th out of the 11 acts in the public vote.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/urfA2QLyaB8</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ray-jessel>Ray Jessel</h2><p>84-year-old Ray Jessel took to the AGT stage on season nine. His comedy singing and piano routine took the audience for a loop in his audition. It’s safe to say they were not expecting such vulgar lyrics from such a seemingly sweet old man. On stage, he performed his original comedy song “What She’s Got/ The Penis Song” for the crowd. All four judges voted “yes” sending him onto the next round. However, Ray was not seen again in the competition, leaving us to assume he was eliminated in Judgement Week.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/UHHRpQpa_48</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-zimmers>The Zimmers</h2><p>The Zimmers are an elderly band that took the BGT stage on series six. The retirees were aged 66-88. In their audition, one member performed a brief rendition of “What the World Needs Now Is Love” by Jackie DeShannon. It didn’t seem like the audience was digging it all that much, if you recall the faces in the audience. Just then, each group member turned around to dress in gold hats and chains. In a dramatic twist, they performed “Fight for Your Right” by the Beastie Boys. The group was described as “inspiring” and “magnificent.” They advanced to the next round and later reached the Semifinals stage.</p><figure class=wp-block-embed readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/-m0EZO5O2dM</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-granny-g>Granny G</h2><p>Granny G was a notable 80-year-old rapper on season seven of AGT. Her audition on the season second episode consisted of an original song about family values. She rapped about the responsibilities men must uphold two when they participate in making a child. Granny G was a standout act in the Vegas Round and was sorted into the “Rappers” category. Her performance at this stage consisted of her rapping about her younger years. While she was hilarious, her act was not strong enough to send her to the Quarterfinals.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/maddie-poppe-american-idol-live-2018-billboard-1548.jpg alt="6 Performers Who Didn’t Get a Single Chair Turn on ‘The Voice’ but Really Should Have" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Britain's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zq6pZp6Rq7yztdOeZKCnpGLBorjEp6tmm5%2Bjwaa%2F05qlratdrLWwecKopKmdpJqxbrvVnqlmrJiaeqKzxGamn2VnZXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
