For example, there has been a reduction of N42,500 in the cost of a flight from Abuja to Anambra to N100,000. Additionally, passengers flying from <a href=#>Lagos</a> to Kano will prepare to spend N70,000, which is N72,500 less than the February fare.</p><p class=align-left>On the Lagos-Uyo route, Ibom Air also saw a drop in pricing; the current cost is N96,000, down from N150,000 in March.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2ce642ef711f030c.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Air Peace unveils connecting flights from Abuja, PH, other major cities to London</span></p></a><p class=align-left>On April 30, information was unavailable for more Ibom Air routes connecting Lagos to Calabar and <a href=#>Enugu</a>. Aero Contractors also displayed a drop in pricing for the Lagos-Abuja route. The current fare is N75,000, which is N28,700 less than in March. On April 30, no data was available on Aero Contractors for the Lagos-Kano route.</p><p class=align-left>An economy class ticket on the Lagos-Abuja route cost N118,000 for travellers who chose to use Green Africa last month. Arik Air's March airfares from Lagos to Sokoto and Jos were N244,000 and N142,500, respectively. Meanwhile, those planning to fly to Green Africa on April 30th may now take advantage of a notable price cut, with economy tickets costing N73,000—a N45,000 savings from March rates.</p><h2>Why price is declining</h2><p class=align-left>The number of operating aircraft in the industry had dropped to 43 in January 2024, as some of the aircraft taken out for checks were still in maintenance facilities overseas.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f1ea85ba35fd128b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dealers crash cooking gas price to N1,100 per kg as stronger naira pushes down costs</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Daily Sun reported that this could have contributed to the increase in airfare between February and March.</p><p class=align-left>Aviation analyst and principal managing partner at Avaero Capital, Sindy Foster, said the price decreased to the current off-peak period (typically Q1).</p><p class=align-left>During this low-traffic period, airlines strategically adjust fares to attract passengers and cover operational costs, including aircraft maintenance.</p>“When you are in a low season period such as we are now, airlines try to maximise whatever little revenue they currently get so that they can cover their cost of operation, maintain their aircraft and still operate safely and profitably, even though it is debatable how profitable the aviation industry can possibly be in Nigeria,” she said.<h2>Air Peace unveils connecting flights</h2><p class=align-left><strong>Legit.ng </strong>reported that Air Peace has now extended its <a href=#>passenger connections offer </a>to London from Abuja, Asaba, Benin, Enugu, Owerri, Warri, and Port Harcourt, following the success of its Lagos-London service.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/240ada8a941489db.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>NNPC speaks on fuel subsidy as filling stations slash petrol pump price</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This means that travellers from the states on the list can seamlessly travel to Lagos, where they can connect with Air Peace to reach London, and their bags will arrive at Gatwick airport.</p><p class=align-left>Following the announcement, Nigerians expressed enthusiasm, saying that if the service is seamless, Air Peace will have an advantage over other carriers on the route.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkr7a%2FyKecrKtdmrCwus6msGihnpnCtMDRsmZqbWhtg3l%2BjKemZqZhaX1xfI9mnqinlGK7psPSZpqoq6Rirqq%2BjKmcmpuVYrGiusBmmKKqXai5or%2FHnqpmnJ%2BisrTAyJxkmqGim66zsY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
