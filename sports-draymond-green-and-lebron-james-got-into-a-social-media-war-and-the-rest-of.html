It was a well-executed joke that referenced both the efficiency with which the Warriors finished off the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Cavs' home stadium, the Quicken Loans Arena.</p><p>It was easy to think James would miss the remark. After all, he had been seen on Instagram earlier in the day too busy in the gym dancing, working, and showing off his newly shaven head to spend time watching the Warriors celebrate the title.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>But as the parade continued, James became aware of the shirt and was ready to zing back at Green with one of the internet's most tried-and-true jokes.</p><p>James hit Green with a "That's what she said."</p><p>The internet took notice and was quick to declare James had won the internet for the day. At the moment, it was true — James had trolled the troller. It was a move of social-media jiujitsu the likes of which is rarely seen, especially among such high-profile personalities.</p><p>The move was so vicious that other NBA players got involved. James' teammates JR Smith and Tristan Thompson popped into the comments to show their support for the Cavs superstar with a few emojis.</p><p>Even more eye-catching, however, were the likes on James' post — notably those of Russell Westbrook and James Harden, former teammates of Kevin Durant's in Oklahoma City.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>For a moment, it seemed as though the flame war had settled. The Warriors had gotten the best of the Cavs on the court, James had gotten the best of Green, and players from around the league had shared a final chuckle together before the offseason.</p><p>But Green wasn't going to give up that easily. He shared a pic of the freshly shorn head of James with the caption "Them dubs finally made him go bald!!!" with "Dubs" being a popular moniker for the Warriors.</p><p>This is a certified "shots fired" situation.</p><p>No word yet on which players from around the league have liked Green's post, but rest assured eagle-eyed social-media followers are on the case.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p70qmmq6yjZMCxu9GtqmacopbGrrvNnWSgqpWau26tzZ1kpZ2Sp7yvecmapJ6rXZy8tXnIp6uoZZFiwLCvyJqjZqWVmbaiedaaqWaZnpl6tbTEZqmeq6RivKd7l6Srb5ymmA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
